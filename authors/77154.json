{"title":"Electronic structures of diplatinum complexes","uri":"","abstract":"The unusual photophys. properties of d8d8 complexes have intrigued inorg. chemists for many years. Nilay\nHazari and I (with other good friends) worked on dipalladium electronic structures during the time he was in\nthe Bercaw-Labinger group at Caltech. In my lecture in his honor, I will discuss the latest developments in the\nfield, with emphasis on work by Jay Winkler and Yan Choi Lam on diplatinum photophysics, and by Bryan\nHunter, Tania Darnton, Mike Hill, Tony Vlcek, and Standa Zalis on rare (unique) 6p-sigma-bonded complexes.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251656","docid":251656,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252882","fileid":1252882,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251656,"filename":"Gray_2017pINOR-6.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"1be5ca7815f23ebda548af55b0d56ffa","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":88391,"mtime":"2017-05-03 17:50:56","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77154/1/Gray_2017pINOR-6.pdf"}],"eprintid":77154,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Gray_2017pINOR-6.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77154,"rev_number":9,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/54","datestamp":"2017-05-03 18:03:12","lastmod":"2017-05-03 18:03:12","status_changed":"2017-05-03 18:03:12","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Harry B.","family":"Gray","id":"Gray-H-B","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"INOR-6","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-105050009","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-105050009","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
