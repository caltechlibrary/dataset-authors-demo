{"title":"Unique extremality in the tangent space of the universal Teichmueller space","uri":"","abstract":"The primary purpose of this paper is to announce some results obtained by the authors, including characterizations of unique extremality and examples of unique extremal dilatation of nonconstant modulus. These results bring much light on the question of unique extremality. The examples actually are a surprise and give answer to a longstanding question posed by Teichmüller, Rech and the others.","documents":null,"note":"© 1998 Taylor \u0026 Francis. \n\nReceived 04 Sep 1996.","id":77223,"rev_number":7,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/72/23","datestamp":"2017-05-05 19:23:06","lastmod":"2017-05-16 20:09:56","status_changed":"2017-05-05 19:23:06","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"V.","family":"Bozin","id":"Bozin-V","orcid":""},{"given":"V.","family":"Marković","id":"Markovic-V","orcid":""},{"given":"M.","family":"Mateljevic","id":"Mateljević-M","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"uniquely extremal dilatation; unique Hahn-Banach extension; Mergelyan's sets; Hamilton and Reich sequences","date":"1998","date_type":"published","publication":"Integral Transforms and Special Functions","volume":"6","number":"1-4","pagerange":"145-149","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170505-111451369","refereed":true,"issn":"1065-2469","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170505-111451369","related_url":[{"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10652469808819158","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10652469808819158","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
