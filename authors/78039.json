{"title":"Close Binary Progenitors and Ejected Companions of\nThermonuclear Supernovae","uri":"","abstract":"Hot subdwarf stars (sdO/Bs) are evolved core helium-burning stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes, which can be formed by common envelope ejection. Close sdB binaries with massive white dwarf (WD) companions are potential progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae type Ia (SN Ia). We discovered such a progenitor candidate as well as a candidate for a surviving companion star, which escapes from the Galaxy. More candidates for both types of objects have been found by cross-matching known sdB stars with proper motion and light curve catalogues. We found 72 sdO/B candidates with high Galactic restframe velocities, 12 of them might be unbound to our Galaxy. Furthermore, we discovered the second-most compact sdB+WD binary known. However, due to the low mass of the WD companion, it is unlikely to be a SN Ia progenitor.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253398","docid":253398,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1268251","fileid":1268251,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253398,"filename":"509-0079.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"463e85405a3c289c42a374e13e387880","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":253619,"mtime":"2017-06-09 13:58:52","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/78039/1/509-0079.pdf"}],"eprintid":78039,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"509-0079.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253399","docid":253399,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1268254","fileid":1268254,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253399,"filename":"1612.03135.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"2924e6e1405ac2f30fe25e4c063edcd2","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":228018,"mtime":"2017-06-09 14:00:18","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/78039/2/1612.03135.pdf"}],"eprintid":78039,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1612.03135.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2017 Astronomical Society of the Pacific.","id":78039,"rev_number":10,"userid":772,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/80/39","datestamp":"2017-06-09 16:13:59","lastmod":"2017-06-09 16:13:59","status_changed":"2017-06-09 16:13:59","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"S.","family":"Geier","id":"Geier-S","orcid":""},{"given":"T.","family":"Kupfer","id":"Kupfer-T","orcid":""},{"given":"U.","family":"Heber","id":"Heber-U","orcid":""},{"given":"P.","family":"Nemeth","id":"Nemeth-P","orcid":""},{"given":"E.","family":"Ziegerer","id":"Ziegerer-E","orcid":""},{"given":"A.","family":"Irrgang","id":"Irrgang-A","orcid":""},{"given":"M.","family":"Schindewolf","id":"Schindewolf-M","orcid":""},{"given":"T.
