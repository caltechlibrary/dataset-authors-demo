{"title":"Genomic DNA functionalized architected materials fabricated via two-photon lithography for drug capture","uri":"","abstract":"Two photon lithog. has recently emerged as one of the most powerful tools for fabricating structures with\nvirtually any geometry. This architectural versatility renders these 3D polymer structures useful for many\ntechnol. applications, including drug delivery and tissue engineering. While significant headway has been made\nin understanding the physics of the two-photon process and the mech. properties of these architected structures, making these structures have the right functional groups still remains a challenge. This is esp. important if we want to utilize these structures for biomedical applications, as it is often necessary to have\ncontrol over the chem. functionality on the surface and/or in the vol. of these 3D materials. In this talk, we describe a facile method of fabricating functional architected materials via the use of a functional acrylate monomer synthesized via the thiol -Michael addn. We then demonstrate the application of this by fabricating amine-functionalized structures which are then post-functionalized with genomic DNA for use as a drug capture device.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251596","docid":251596,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252010","fileid":1252010,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251596,"filename":"Yee_2017pPOLY-413.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"2eb6ef57a0651c00099f74d3495b7aa1","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":89958,"mtime":"2017-05-02 16:57:04","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77121/1/Yee_2017pPOLY-413.pdf"}],"eprintid":77121,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Yee_2017pPOLY-413.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77121,"rev_number":9,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/21","datestamp":"2017-05-02 17:57:50","lastmod":"2017-05-02 17:57:50","status_changed":"2017-05-02 17:57:50","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Daryl","family":"Yee","id":"Yee-Daryl-W","orcid":""},{"given":"Michael D.","family":"Schulz","id":"Schulz-M-D","orcid":""},{"given":"Carl","family":"Blumenfeld","id":"Blumenfeld-C-M","orcid":""},{"given":"Robert H.","family":"Grubbs","id":"Grubbs-R-H","orcid":"0000-0002-0057-7817"},{"given":"Julia R.","family":"Greer","id":"Greer-J-R","orcid":"0000-0002-9675-1508"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"POLY-413","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170502-095652517","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170502-095652517","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
