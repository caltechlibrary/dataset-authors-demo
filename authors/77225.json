{"title":"Microscopic Derivation of the Ginzburg-Landau Model","uri":"","abstract":"We present a summary of our recent rigorous derivation of the celebrated Ginzburg–Landau (GL) theory, starting from the microscopic Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) model. Close to the critical temperature, GL arises as an effective theory on the macroscopic scale. The relevant scaling limit is semiclassical in nature, and  semiclassical analysis, with minimal regularity assumptions, plays an important part in our proof.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251816","docid":251816,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254303","fileid":1254303,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251816,"filename":"1209.1080.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"9071f50d688de624509a9a8e69f68855","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":144175,"mtime":"2017-05-05 18:29:22","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77225/1/1209.1080.pdf"}],"eprintid":77225,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1209.1080.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2012 by the authors.
