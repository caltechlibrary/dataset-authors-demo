{"title":"Germanium nanowires: from synthesis, surface chemistry, assembly to devices","uri":"","abstract":"In order to continue the ever impressive and successful scaling pace of MOSFETs, tremendous research efforts have been spent to seek new materials to complement or replace Si as the Si-based ones are predicted to reach theoretical limits soon. Ge has low band gaps and high carrier mobilities, thus offering appealing potentials\nas a candidate of choice for future electronics. For the same purpose of discovering new materials, another area of interest is low dimensional nanostructures such as nanowires\n(NWs), owing to the facile synthesis, high structure perfection and superior properties. In this context, Ge NW has combined advantages and is particularly promising. I focus on this subject and have advanced in a wide range, from understanding and controlling synthesis and surface chemistry, to highly ordered assembly and devices with excellent performance.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251582","docid":251582,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1251888","fileid":1251888,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251582,"filename":"04097621.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"76a9fa762f351d9e39bbb8a96ec714e5","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":3409820,"mtime":"2017-05-01 23:24:32","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77112/1/04097621.pdf"}],"eprintid":77112,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04097621.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2006 IEEE.","id":77112,"rev_number":9,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/12","datestamp":"2017-05-01 23:56:52","lastmod":"2017-05-01 23:56:52","status_changed":"2017-05-01 23:56:52","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Dunwei","family":"Wang","id":"Wang-Dunwei","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-06","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"244-248","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170501-160107491","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170501-160107491","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRC.2006.305077","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4097621/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"D.
