{"title":"Global Exponential Stability of FAST TCP","uri":"","abstract":"We consider a single-link multi-source network with the FAST TCP sources. We propose a continuous-time dynamic model for the FAST TCP sources and a static model to describe the queuing delay behavior at the link. The proposed model turns out to be in a form revealing the network feedback delay, which allows us to analyze FAST TCP in due consideration of the network feedback delay. Based on the proposed model, we show the boundedness of both each source's congestion window and the queuing delay at the link; and the global exponential stability under a trivial condition that each source's congestion control parameter a is positive. The simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed model and the global exponential stability of FAST TCP.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251920","docid":251920,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255336","fileid":1255336,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251920,"filename":"04177861.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"945c3721461e00867189e9e8d8bec862","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":224228,"mtime":"2017-05-08 23:57:21","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77272/1/04177861.pdf"}],"eprintid":77272,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04177861.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE.","id":77272,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/72/72","datestamp":"2017-05-16 20:24:18","lastmod":"2017-05-16 20:24:18","status_changed":"2017-05-16 20:24:18","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Joon-Young","family":"Choi","id":"Choi-Joon-Young","orcid":""},{"given":"Kyungmo","family":"Koo","id":"Koo-Kyungmo","orcid":""},{"given":"David X.","family":"Wei","id":"Wei-David-X","orcid":""},{"given":"Jin S.","family":"Lee","id":"Lee-Jin-S","orcid":""},{"given":"Steven H.","family":"Low","id":"Low-S-H","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-12","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"639-643","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170508-165210453","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170508-165210453","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2006.377711","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4177861/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[1] Raj Jain, K.
