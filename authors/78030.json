{"title":"Searching for Be Stars in the Open Cluster NGC663","uri":"","abstract":"With the Palomar Transient Factory Survey, we report Be stars candidates in the open cluster NGC 663, determined by Hα photometry which is to initiating a program to search for emission stars in clusters of different ages. We affirm the membership of these candidate by 2MASS magnitudes and colors, and by proper motions. Through the verifications, one known Be stars was ruled out because its inconsistent proper motions, and four new Be stars were discovered. More emission-line sources were also discovered, including non-member Be stars, dwarfs, and giants.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253384","docid":253384,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1268121","fileid":1268121,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253384,"filename":"506-0271.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"c3e4bc663fdafafa736db6c8f4ad1901","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":297738,"mtime":"2017-06-08 18:13:06","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/78030/1/506-0271.pdf"}],"eprintid":78030,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"506-0271.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2016 Astronomical Society of the Pacific.","id":78030,"rev_number":10,"userid":772,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/80/30","datestamp":"2017-06-08 21:38:07","lastmod":"2017-06-08 21:38:07","status_changed":"2017-06-08 21:38:07","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"C.
