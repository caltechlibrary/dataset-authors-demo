{"title":"The Design and Implementation of the Transatlantic Mission-Oriented Production and Experimental Networks","uri":"","abstract":"In this paper we present the design and implementation of the mission-oriented USLHCNet for HEP research community and the UltraLight network testbed. The design philosophy for these networks is to help meet the data-intensive computing challenges of the next generation of particle physics experiments with a comprehensive, network-focused approach. Instead of treating the network as a static, unchanging and unmanaged set of intercomputer links, we are developing and using it as a dynamic, configurable, and closely monitored resource that is managed from end-to-end. In this paper we will present our work in the various areas of the project including infrastructure construction, protocol research and application development. Our goal is to construct a next-generation global system that is able to meet the data processing, distribution, access and analysis needs of the particle physics community.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251626","docid":251626,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252642","fileid":1252642,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251626,"filename":"04031015.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"5349605f0df179c6372fbfb2eb7fcd78","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1079805,"mtime":"2017-05-03 00:49:49","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77136/1/04031015.pdf"}],"eprintid":77136,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04031015.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE. \n\nThis work is partly supported by the Department of Energy \ngrants: DE-FC02-01ER25459, DE-FG02-92-ER40701,    \nDE-AC02-76CH03000 (Particle Physics DataGrid project), DE-FG02-04ER-25613 (Lambda Station project), \nDE-AC02-76SF00515 (Terapaths  project)  and  DE-FG02-05ER41359 (LHCnet project), and by the National Science Foundation grants: PHY-0122557, PHY-0427110 (Ultralight project) , ANI-0113425, EIA-0303620 (WAN in Lab project).
