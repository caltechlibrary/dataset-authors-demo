{"title":"Metal-oxos in chemistry and biology","uri":"","abstract":"The dianionic oxo ligand occupies a very special place in coordination chem., owing to its ability to stabilize high oxidn. states of metals. My first papers on the ligand field theory of multiple bonding in metal-oxos appeared in the first vol. of Inorg. Chem. The theory, which accounts for the optical and EPR spectroscopic properties of these complexes, also predicts that there must be an \"oxo wall\" between Fe-Ru-Os and Co-Rh-Ir in the periodic table. There have been many attempts to break down the wall, but it is still in pretty good shape!. I will review this early work, then discuss the roles metal-oxos play in two of the most\nimportant chem. reactions on planet Earth, hydrocarbon oxygenation catalyzed by cytochrome P 450, and solar-driven water oxidn. catalyzed by photosystem-II. Water splitting catalyzed by inorg. materials also is of great current interest. In this area, recent work has shown that Fe(VI)-oxos likely are key intermediates in water oxidn. catalyzed by robust LDH-(Fe,Ni)-nanosheets.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251650","docid":251650,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252830","fileid":1252830,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251650,"filename":"Gray_2017pINOR-608.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"a071615f4ca5d1e5b52a72d005acbfe6","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":86267,"mtime":"2017-05-03 17:33:42","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77148/1/Gray_2017pINOR-608.pdf"}],"eprintid":77148,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Gray_2017pINOR-608.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77148,"rev_number":7,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/48","datestamp":"2017-05-03 18:12:23","lastmod":"2017-05-03 18:12:23","status_changed":"2017-05-03 18:12:23","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Harry B.","family":"Gray","id":"Gray-H-B","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"INOR-608","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-103335721","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-103335721","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
