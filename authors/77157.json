{"title":"Simultaneous measurement of the B^0 meson lifetime and mixing frequency with B^0→D*−l+ν_ℓ decays","uri":"","abstract":"We measure the B^0 lifetime τ_B^0 and the B0−B0[overbar] oscillation frequency Δm_d with a sample of approximately 14000 exclusively reconstructed B^0→D*−ℓ+ν_l signal events, selected from 23 million BB[overbar] pairs recorded at the Υ(4S) resonance with the BABAR detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. The decay position of the other B is determined with the remaining tracks in the event, and its b-quark flavor at the time of decay is determined with a tagging algorithm that exploits the correlation between the flavor of the b quark and the charges of its decay products. The lifetime and oscillation frequencies are measured simultaneously with an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit that uses, for each event, the measured difference in decay times of the two B mesons (Δt), the calculated uncertainty on Δt, the signal and background probabilities, and b-quark tagging information for the other B. The results are τ_B^0=(1.523^(+0.024)_(−0.023)±0.022)ps and Δm_d=(0.492±0.018±0.013)ps^(−1). The statistical correlation coefficient between τ_B0 and Δm_d is -0.22.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251661","docid":251661,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252929","fileid":1252929,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251661,"filename":"PhysRevD.67.072002.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"74c0fe5eb3c51706ff7706e4a6501f60","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":927445,"mtime":"2017-05-03 18:14:17","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77157/1/PhysRevD.67.072002.pdf"}],"eprintid":77157,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"PhysRevD.67.072002.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2003 American Physical Society. \n\nReceived 5 December 2002; published 24 April 2003. \n\nWe are grateful for the extraordinary contributions of our\nPEP-II colleagues in achieving the excellent luminosity and\nmachine conditions that have made this work possible.
