{"title":"The Price of Distributed Design in Optimal Control","uri":"","abstract":"We study control design strategies which, when presented with a plant made of interconnected subsystems, construct a sub-controller for each one of them using only a model of this particular subsystem. We prove that, for a class of linear time-invariant, discrete-time systems, any such distributed control strategy must have a worst-case performance at least twice the optimal. The best distributed design strategy is one that results in a deadbeat controller for every plant.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251627","docid":251627,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252649","fileid":1252649,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251627,"filename":"04177749.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"7e0a2df9484c26381cf774f72dee81a5","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":139458,"mtime":"2017-05-03 00:55:28","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77137/1/04177749.pdf"}],"eprintid":77137,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04177749.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE. \n\nJ.-Ch.D. acknowledges the support of the Belgian Program on Interuniversity Attraction Poles, the ARC “Large Graphs and Networks”, and of a FNRS fellowship.","id":77137,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/37","datestamp":"2017-05-03 14:57:42","lastmod":"2017-05-03 14:57:42","status_changed":"2017-05-03 14:57:42","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Jean-Charles","family":"Delvenne","id":"Delvenne-J-C","orcid":""},{"given":"Cédric","family":"Langbort","id":"Langbort-C","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-12","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"3640-3645","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170502-175205436","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170502-175205436","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2006.377316","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4177749/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[1] R.
