{"title":"Moldable photo-responsive elastomers from thermoreversible networks formed by triblock copolymer selfassembly","uri":"","abstract":"Photo-responsive soft materials that retain the responsive optical anisotropy of liq. crystals can serve as\nmechano-optic actuators for applications that include non-invasively steering fiber optics for biomedical applications. Here we report that reproducible thermoreversible networks are formed by self-assembly of\ncoil-liq. crystal-coil triblock copolymers: the coil (polystyrene) end-blocks phase segregate from the liq. crystal midblock, forming of uniform and uniformly-spaced phys. crosslinks, These polymers are elastic in the melt\n(at room temp.) and can be easily molded into desired shapes. Starting from identical triblock prepolymers\n(with polystyerene end blocks and 1,2-polybutadiene midblocks), a matched pair (3% azobenzene, and no\nazobenzene) of liq. crystal triblock copolymers was synthesized. These triblocks were then blended to prep. a\nseries of elastomers with 0 to 3% azobenzene groups, while matching in nearly all other phys. properties\n(cross-link d., modulus, birefringence, etc.), and photo-response was quant. measured, allowing us to isolate\nthe effect of concn. of photo-responsive azobenzene groups on photo-response.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251670","docid":251670,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1253037","fileid":1253037,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251670,"filename":"Kurji_2017pPMSE-593.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"02653b7575166b396ec13b7c19643981","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":90321,"mtime":"2017-05-03 19:51:17","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77159/1/Kurji_2017pPMSE-593.pdf"}],"eprintid":77159,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Kurji_2017pPMSE-593.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77159,"rev_number":7,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/59","datestamp":"2017-05-03 19:54:06","lastmod":"2017-05-03 19:54:06","status_changed":"2017-05-03 19:54:06","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Zuleikha","family":"Kurji","id":"Kurji-Zuleikha","orcid":""},{"given":"Elizabeth","family":"Bernhardt","id":"Bernhardt-E","orcid":""},{"given":"Mark G.","family":"Kuzyk","id":"Kuzyk-M-G","orcid":""},{"given":"Julia A.","family":"Kornfield","id":"Kornfield-J-A","orcid":"0000-0001-6746-8634"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"PMSE-593","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-125111530","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-125111530","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
