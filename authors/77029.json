{"title":"Reverse Engineering MAC","uri":"","abstract":"This paper reverse engineers backoff-based random-access MAC protocols in ad-hoc networks. We show that the contention resolution algorithm in such protocols is implicitly participating in a non-cooperative game. Each link attempts to maximize a selfish local utility function, whose exact shape is reverse engineered from the protocol description, through a stochastic subgradient method in which the link updates its persistence probability based on its transmission success or failure. We prove that existence of a Nash equilibrium is guaranteed in general. The minimum amount of backoff aggressiveness needed for uniqueness of Nash equilibrium and convergence of the best response strategy are established as a function of user density. Convergence properties and connection with the best response strategy are also proved for variants of the stochastic-subgradient-based dynamics of the game. Together with known results in reverse engineering TCP and BGP, this paper completes the recent efforts in reverse engineering the main protocols in layers 2-4.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251420","docid":251420,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1250476","fileid":1250476,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251420,"filename":"01666466.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"b267efddacd5cc501c01e245ce8e9b1d","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":290235,"mtime":"2017-04-27 23:03:44","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77029/1/01666466.pdf"}],"eprintid":77029,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01666466.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2007 IEEE.\n\nThis work was supported by Yonsei University research fund of 2005 and NSF Grants CCF-0440443, CNS-0417607, CCF-0448012, and CNS-0427677.","id":77029,"rev_number":9,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/70/29","datestamp":"2017-04-27 23:16:56","lastmod":"2017-04-27 23:16:56","status_changed":"2017-04-27 23:16:56","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Ao","family":"Tang","id":"Tang-Ao","orcid":""},{"given":"Jang-Won","family":"Lee","id":"Lee-Jang-Won","orcid":""},{"given":"Jianwei","family":"Huang","id":"Huang-Jianwei","orcid":""},{"given":"Mung","family":"Chiang","id":"Chiang-Mung","orcid":""},{"given":"A.
