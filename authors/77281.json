{"title":"The logarithmic spiral: a counterexample to the K = 2 conjecture","uri":"","abstract":"Given a nonempty compact connected subset X ⊂ S^2 with complement a simply-connected open subset Ω ⊂ S^2, let Dome(Ω) be the boundary of the hyperbolic convex hull in H^3 of X. We show that if X is a certain logarithmic spiral, then we obtain a counterexample to the conjecture of Thurston and Sullivan that there is a 2-quasiconformal homeomorphism Ω → Dome(Ω) which extends to the identity map on their common boundary in S^2. This leads to related counterexamples when the boundary is real analytic, or a finite union of intervals (straight intervals, if we take S^2 = C ∪ {∞}. We also show how this counterexample enables us to construct a related counterexample which is a domain of discontinuity of a torsion-free quasifuchsian group with compact quotient. Another result is that the average long range bending of the convex hull boundary associated to a certain logarithmic spiral is approximately .98π/2, which is substantially larger than that of any previously known example.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251929","docid":251929,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255397","fileid":1255397,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251929,"filename":"3597321.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"81623e0653abae4f231386ef214f52b0","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1079509,"mtime":"2017-05-09 13:52:41","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77281/1/3597321.pdf"}],"eprintid":77281,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"3597321.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252377","docid":252377,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1258871","fileid":1258871,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252377,"filename":"EM-1.ps","mime_type":"application/postscript","hash":"48ca524f12e1fa101384c3eeb71afc0f","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":6027643,"mtime":"2017-05-17 19:41:34","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77281/2/EM-1.ps"}],"eprintid":77281,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/postscript","format":"application/postscript","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"EM-1.ps","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2005 Annals of Mathematics.\n\nReceived: 9 January 2002\nRevised: 5 March 2003\nAccepted: 12 February 2003\nPublished online: 1 March 2009\n\n\n\n","id":77281,"rev_number":12,"userid":772,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/72/81","datestamp":"2017-05-09 20:56:01","lastmod":"2017-05-17 19:41:34","status_changed":"2017-05-09 20:56:01","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"D.
