{"title":"Photo-conductivity measurements of water-rich ices at cryogenic temperatures","uri":"","abstract":"Solid water (H_2O) ice is found in high abundances in a large variety of astrophys. environments: e.g. icy\nmantles coating interstellar dust grains, in icy bodies like comets and satellites like Europa where exposure to\nenergetic photons, ions and electrons is significant. In these conditions, solid H O is known to dissoc. into H\nand OH fragments under VUV irradn. while promoting ionization of org. impurities such as polycyclic arom.\nhydrocarbons (PAHs). This was explained in terms of the relatively high electron affinity of the H_2O mols. and of\nthe OH fragments which, in synergy with the thermodn. stability assocd. with the solvation of ions in solid H_2O,\nenhances the ionization of pos. charged PAHs. If such ions are indeed produced, these will change the dielec.\nproperties of the ice and can move inside the H_2O matrix when a bias is applied, depending on the ice temp.\nOur work reports on the investigation of photocurrents in millimeter-sized, water-rich ices contg. org.\nimpurities (e.g. toluene) and aims at understanding how these measurements correlate with the desorption of\nvolatiles during vacuum UV (VUV, e.g. 121.6 nm) and electron (2 keV) irradn.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251679","docid":251679,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1253151","fileid":1253151,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251679,"filename":"Marchione_2017pPHYS-453.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"715060ee819f8bd7d2f21bbc9ba99ead","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":89869,"mtime":"2017-05-03 21:38:03","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77166/1/Marchione_2017pPHYS-453.pdf"}],"eprintid":77166,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Marchione_2017pPHYS-453.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77166,"rev_number":9,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/66","datestamp":"2017-05-04 01:34:38","lastmod":"2017-05-04 01:34:38","status_changed":"2017-05-04 01:34:38","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Demian","family":"Marchione","id":"Marchione-D","orcid":""},{"given":"Rui","family":"Yang","id":"Yang-Rui","orcid":""},{"given":"Murthy S.","family":"Gudipati","id":"Gudipati-M-S","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"PHYS-453","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-143757489","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-143757489","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
