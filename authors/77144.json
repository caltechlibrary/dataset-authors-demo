{"title":"Analysis of a balanced analog multiplier for an arbitrary number of signed inputs","uri":"","abstract":"We present an extension of the double-balanced current-commutating analog multiplier (also known as the Gilbert cell) that enables the multiplication of an arbitrary number of signed differential input voltages. A general analysis of the circuit for an arbitrary device nonlinearity is provided, and simulations on a bulk CMOS process as well as measurement results of a discrete bipolar implementation are reported.","documents":null,"note":"© 2016 John Wiley \u0026 Sons, Ltd. \n\nIssue online: 10 April 2017; Version of record online: 8 August 2016; Manuscript Accepted: 21 June 2016; Manuscript Revised: 17 May 2016; Manuscript Received: 13 January 2016.","id":77144,"rev_number":6,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/44","datestamp":"2017-05-03 17:55:24","lastmod":"2017-05-03 17:55:24","status_changed":"2017-05-03 17:55:24","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Brian","family":"Hong","id":"Hong-Brian","orcid":""},{"given":"Ali","family":"Hajimiri","id":"Hajimiri-A","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"analog multiplier; Gilbert cell; nonlinear circuit; transistor; intermodulation; bandwidth","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"International Journal of Circuit Theory and Applications","volume":"45","number":"4","pagerange":"483-501","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-094736352","refereed":true,"issn":"0098-9886","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-094736352","related_url":[{"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cta.2243","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cta.2243/abstract","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"Hong, B., and Hajimiri, A.
