{"title":"Uniformly Bounded Maximal ϕ-Disks, Bers Space and Harmonic Maps","uri":"","abstract":"We characterize Bers space by means of maximal ϕ-disks. As an application we show that the Hopf differential of a quasiregular harmonic map with respect to strongly negatively curved metric belongs to Bers space. Also we give further sufficient or necessary conditions for a holomorphic function to belong to Bers space.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251817","docid":251817,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254313","fileid":1254313,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251817,"filename":"S0002-9939-00-05325-9.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"08ed8b23fc24e9da0bf852b90b4f7800","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":194557,"mtime":"2017-05-05 18:47:38","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77226/1/S0002-9939-00-05325-9.pdf"}],"eprintid":77226,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"S0002-9939-00-05325-9.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2000 American Mathematical Society. \n\nReceived by the editors April 20, 1998 and, in revised form, August 27, 1998 and November 18, 1998. \n\nWe wish to thank the referee for numerous useful comments and suggestions which greatly improved the exposition of our paper and for pointing out that our results can possibly be of use in a number of popular open problems.
