{"title":"On the Performance of Sphere Decoding of Block Codes","uri":"","abstract":"The performance of sphere decoding of block codes over a variety of channels is investigated. We derive a tight bound on the performance of maximum likelihood decoding of linear codes on q-ary symmetric channels. We use this result to bound the performance of q-ary hard decision sphere decoders. We also derive a tight bound on the performance of soft decision sphere decoders on the AWGN channel for BPSK and M-PSK modulated block codes. The performance of soft decision sphere decoding of arbitrary finite lattices or block codes is also analyzed.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251926","docid":251926,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255379","fileid":1255379,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251926,"filename":"04036311.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"9f688c3f98c679c50741207d53d46906","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":278360,"mtime":"2017-05-09 00:44:16","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77278/1/04036311.pdf"}],"eprintid":77278,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04036311.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE. \n\nThis research was supported by NSF grant no.
