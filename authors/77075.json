{"title":"A 'liquid-solid' phase transition in a simple model for swarming, based on the 'no flat-spots' theorem for subharmonic functions","uri":"","abstract":"We consider a non-local shape optimization problem, which is motivated by a simple model for swarming and other self-assembly/aggregation models, and prove the existence of different phases. A technical key ingredient, which we establish, is that a strictly subharmonic function cannot be constant on a set of positive measure.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251502","docid":251502,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1251177","fileid":1251177,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251502,"filename":"1607.07971.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"349ce9c8016b51deeda914004e029b20","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":248185,"mtime":"2017-04-28 23:13:07","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77075/1/1607.07971.pdf"}],"eprintid":77075,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1607.07971.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"","id":77075,"rev_number":8,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/70/75","datestamp":"2017-04-28 23:35:38","lastmod":"2017-04-28 23:35:38","status_changed":"2017-04-28 23:35:38","type":"monograph","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Rupert L.","family":"Frank","id":"Frank-R-L","orcid":""},{"given":"Elliott H.","family":"Lieb","id":"Lieb-E-H","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"submitted","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2016-07-27","date_type":"submitted","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170428-161302774","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170428-161302774","related_url":[{"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07971","type":"arxiv","description":"Discussion Paper"}],"referencetext":["[1] F.
