{"title":"Small molecule activation with molybdenum complexes supported by diphosphine-arene ligands","uri":"","abstract":"Multidentate phosphines connected by terphenyl linkers have been employed to support mono and multimetallic complexes. The central arene of the terphenyl unit acts as a labile ligand and coordinates in a variety of modes as a function of metal and oxidn. state. Addnl., this arene can be non-innocent with respect to redox and H-transfer chem. Mo complexes with P-arene-P pincers show activation of small mols. such as H_2, N_2, CO_2, O_2, and CO. The formation of rare structural motifs, such as terminal carbide and phosphide complexes, has been demonstrated with this Mo framework. The effect of ligand design on reactivity will be discussed.\n","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251669","docid":251669,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1253027","fileid":1253027,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251669,"filename":"Agapie_2017pINOR-3.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"dd64ff9af0fcc750294077bb28d44ee2","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":88872,"mtime":"2017-05-03 19:48:32","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77158/1/Agapie_2017pINOR-3.pdf"}],"eprintid":77158,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Agapie_2017pINOR-3.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77158,"rev_number":8,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/58","datestamp":"2017-05-03 19:54:25","lastmod":"2017-05-03 19:54:25","status_changed":"2017-05-03 19:54:25","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Theodor","family":"Agapie","id":"Agapie-T","orcid":"0000-0002-9692-7614"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"INOR-3","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-124825735","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-124825735","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
