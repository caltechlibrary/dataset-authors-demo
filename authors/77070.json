{"title":"Averaging of nonlinear Schrödinger equations with strong magnetic confinement","uri":"","abstract":"We consider the dynamics of nonlinear Schrödinger equations with strong constant magnetic fields. In an asymptotic scaling limit the system exhibits a purely magnetic confinement, based on the spectral properties of the Landau Hamiltonian. Using an averaging technique we derive an associated effective description via an averaged model of nonlinear Schrödinger type. In a special case this also yields a derivation of the LLL equation.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251497","docid":251497,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1251140","fileid":1251140,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251497,"filename":"1611.01574.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"7c39f02b9ca9adceef5f221218d30012","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":196267,"mtime":"2017-04-28 22:41:25","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77070/1/1611.01574.pdf"}],"eprintid":77070,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1611.01574.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"This publication is based on work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation through grants DMS-1363432 (R.L.F.) and DMS-1348092 (C.S.) and by the ANR project Moonrise ANR-14-CE23-0007-01 (F.M.).","id":77070,"rev_number":10,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/70/70","datestamp":"2017-04-28 23:50:55","lastmod":"2017-04-28 23:50:55","status_changed":"2017-04-28 23:50:55","type":"monograph","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Rupert L.","family":"Frank","id":"Frank-R-L","orcid":""},{"given":"Florian","family":"Méhats","id":"Méhats-F","orcid":""},{"given":"Christof","family":"Sparber","id":"Sparber-C","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"submitted","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"Nonlinear Schrödinger equation, magnetic confinement, Landau levels, averaging","date":"2016-11-05","date_type":"submitted","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170428-154120889","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170428-154120889","related_url":[{"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01574","type":"arxiv","description":"Discussion Paper"}],"referencetext":["1.
