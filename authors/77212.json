{"title":"Semi-classical analysis of the Laplace operator with Robin boundary conditions","uri":"","abstract":"We prove a two-term asymptotic expansion of eigenvalue sums of the Laplacian on a bounded domain with Neumann, or more generally, Robin boundary conditions. We formulate and prove the asymptotics in terms of semi-classical analysis. In this reformulation it is natural to allow the function describing the boundary conditions to depend on the semi-classical parameter and we identify and analyze three different regimes for this dependence.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251783","docid":251783,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254073","fileid":1254073,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251783,"filename":"art%3A10.1007%2Fs13373-012-0028-5.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"1c11587089c9f53a53b9646e8a0a2f2d","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":437682,"mtime":"2017-05-05 16:22:08","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77212/1/art%253A10.1007%252Fs13373-012-0028-5.pdf"}],"eprintid":77212,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"art%3A10.1007%2Fs13373-012-0028-5.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251784","docid":251784,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254075","fileid":1254075,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251784,"filename":"1208.2327.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"a1c96fe212f0257dccd8e7178b37db72","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":335695,"mtime":"2017-05-05 16:22:17","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77212/2/1208.2327.pdf"}],"eprintid":77212,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1208.2327.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2012 The Author(s).
