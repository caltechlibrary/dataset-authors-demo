{"title":"New Polymer Chemistries for Solid Battery Electrolytes","uri":"","abstract":"Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have the potential to dramatically improve the stability and energy d. of Libased\nbatteries, but their low cationic cond. presently limits their usefulness. In this talk I'll cover the recent\nprogress we've made in designing alternative polymer chemistries for SPEs that circumvent the shortcomings\nof conventional polyether-based electrolytes. The talk will include an overview of the new computational\nmethodologies we've developed to characterize the ionic cond. and transport mechanisms of many new polymers, and also highlight a few of the promising new structures we've discovered that have now been exptl. studied. The presentation will also include at least a few anecdotes about Tobin Marks, to whom the author owes much of his scientific formation and who is being honored in this symposium.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251680","docid":251680,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1253158","fileid":1253158,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251680,"filename":"Savoie_2017pINOR-781.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"db1f4cb278c6c9d395d71e9b2bc0e573","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":88993,"mtime":"2017-05-03 21:47:06","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77167/1/Savoie_2017pINOR-781.pdf"}],"eprintid":77167,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Savoie_2017pINOR-781.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77167,"rev_number":8,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/67","datestamp":"2017-05-04 01:33:55","lastmod":"2017-05-04 01:33:55","status_changed":"2017-05-04 01:33:55","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Brett M.","family":"Savoie","id":"Savoie-B-M","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"INOR-781","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-144659632","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-144659632","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
