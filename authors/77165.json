{"title":"Recent advances in olefin metathesis","uri":"","abstract":"Selective olefin metathesis catalysts have been developed over the past several years that control the stereochem. of the metathesis products. Complexes have been prepd. that produce high Z olefins from terminal olefins, select among olefins in a polyolefin and control the tacticity of ROMP polymers. New approaches are being made to the development of E selective systems. These complexes can also be used to prep. highly functional materials such as brush block polymers that assemble into light reflecting photonics crystals.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251678","docid":251678,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1253145","fileid":1253145,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251678,"filename":"Grubbs_2017pINOR-506.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"c455039d8a4bdc415cb6c603060b1353","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":85132,"mtime":"2017-05-03 21:35:16","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77165/1/Grubbs_2017pINOR-506.pdf"}],"eprintid":77165,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Grubbs_2017pINOR-506.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77165,"rev_number":7,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/65","datestamp":"2017-05-04 01:35:13","lastmod":"2017-05-04 01:35:13","status_changed":"2017-05-04 01:35:13","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Robert H.","family":"Grubbs","id":"Grubbs-R-H","orcid":"0000-0002-0057-7817"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"INOR-506","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-143508505","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-143508505","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
