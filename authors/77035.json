{"title":"Low Rate Scalar Quantization for Gaussian Sources and Absolute Error","uri":"","abstract":"This paper considers low resolution scalar quantization for a memoryless Gaussian source with respect to absolute error distortion. It shows that slope of the operational rate-distortion function of scalar quantization is infinite at the point D_(max) where the rate becomes zero. Thus, unlike the situation for squared error distortion, or for Laplacian and exponential sources with squared or absolute error distortion, for a Gaussian source and absolute error, scalar quantization at low rates is far from the Shannon rate-distortion function, i.e. far from the performance of the best lossy coding technique.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251428","docid":251428,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1250557","fileid":1250557,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251428,"filename":"04036432.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"7468cefbb68c38829e14003fa8f7aa75","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":132012,"mtime":"2017-04-28 00:41:40","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77035/1/04036432.pdf"}],"eprintid":77035,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04036432.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE. \n\nThe work of D.
