{"title":"Structure-function studies of tetranuclear iron clusters with a variable interstitial μ4-atom as models of biological active sites","uri":"","abstract":"Multinuclear first-row transition metal clusters contg. bridging one-atom ligands to three or more metal ions are found in complex biol. active sites including the Oxygen Evolving Complex in Photosystem II (μ_3- and μ_4-oxo ligands), and the iron-molybdenum cofactor in nitrogenase (μ_6-carbide). Synthetic tetranuclear clusters have been studied with the goal of understanding how an interstitial atom can affect the chem. of the cluster. These model complexes are composed of a trimetallic core which is connected to an apical metal center by three pyrazolate ligands, and a μ_4-atom (μ_4-F and μ_4-O). The apical metal center possesses a trigonal pyramidal geometry with an open coordination site. The intermol. chem. of these bio-inspired clusters has been investigated to understand the effect of the neighboring metals and bridging atom. When the pyrazolate ligands display Ph substituents, intramol. C-H and C-F bond functionalization occurs upon reaction with oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reagents. More sterically open tetrairon clusters with μ_4-F and μ_4-O interstitial ligands and no Ph substituents have been synthesized. Reactions with OAT reagents suggest the formation of terminal iron-oxo intermediates. The reactivity and properties of these clusters as a function of the μ_4-interstitial atom will be discussed.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251689","docid":251689,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1253229","fileid":1253229,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251689,"filename":"Reed_2017pINOR-65.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"66542ff8095eee8023c16176aac65a7d","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":148597,"mtime":"2017-05-03 22:38:00","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77176/1/Reed_2017pINOR-65.pdf"}],"eprintid":77176,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Reed_2017pINOR-65.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77176,"rev_number":9,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/76","datestamp":"2017-05-04 01:14:12","lastmod":"2017-05-04 01:14:12","status_changed":"2017-05-04 01:14:12","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Christopher","family":"Reed","id":"Reed-C","orcid":""},{"given":"Theodor","family":"Agapie","id":"Agapie-T","orcid":"0000-0002-9692-7614"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"INOR-65","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-153753745","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-153753745","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
