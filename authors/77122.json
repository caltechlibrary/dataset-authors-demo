{"title":"Consequences of low-χ design in block copolymer self-assembly","uri":"","abstract":"We performed the first systematic study of the phase behavior of ABC bottlebrush triblock terpolymers. Along\nthe way, we discovered a new lamellar morphol. with unusual consequences for polymer properties and \nscaling behavior. We synthesized a series of ABC triblock terpolymers having grafted polylactide (L), polystyrene \n(S), and poly(ethylene oxide) (O) side chains. Partial mixing of L and O end blocks due to low-χ design \nproduces a new morphol. (LAM_p) with mesoscopic ACBC connectivity, counter to all known examples for ABC \ntriblock terpolymer self-assembly. For ABC triblock terpolymers, the std. model demands periodic domains \nwith ABCB repeat units (i.e., LAM_3). In our system as designed, however, we can decouple the domain\nconnectivity from the synthesized block connectivity. Other consequences of partial mixing in LAM_p include a\ndramatic decrease in domain spacing with increasing mol. wt. under certain conditions. LAM_p has been\ncharacterized by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and differential\nscanning calorimetry (DSC). SCF theory (SCFT) for brush polymers supports the exptl. model and affirms the\nimportance of χ. Recently, we have extended these insights into low-χ design from ABC triblock terpolymers \nto polymer blends. To the best of our knowledge, these phenomena are unprecedented in block copolymer \nself-assembly. This discovery introduces a new tool for controlling polymer structure and properties in future \nmaterials design.\n","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251597","docid":251597,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252020","fileid":1252020,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251597,"filename":"Chang_2017pPOLY-241.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"b671732dfc5b9b5efb5be99c80eddbf3","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":149489,"mtime":"2017-05-02 17:11:31","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77122/1/Chang_2017pPOLY-241.pdf"}],"eprintid":77122,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Chang_2017pPOLY-241.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77122,"rev_number":15,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/22","datestamp":"2017-05-02 17:56:15","lastmod":"2017-05-03 16:26:50","status_changed":"2017-05-02 17:56:15","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Alice","family":"Chang","id":"Chang-Alice-B","orcid":""},{"given":"Robert H.","family":"Grubbs","id":"Grubbs-R-H","orcid":"0000-0002-0057-7817"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"POLY-241","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170502-101123277","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170502-101123277","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
