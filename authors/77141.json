{"title":"Olefin trimerization with titanium catalysts: MAO/silica-supported variants display higher productivities","uri":"","abstract":"Treatment of dry silica with methylaluminoxane (MAO) followed by (FI)TiCl_3 (FI = (N-(5-methyl-3-(1-\nadamantyl)salicylidene)-2'-(2\"-methoxyphenyl)anilinato), gives a heterogeneous supported ethylene\ntrimerization catalyst, s(FI)Ti, which exhibits productivity more than an order of magnitude higher than its\nhomogeneous analogs. This increase is attributed to a decreased rate of catalyst decompn. via comproportionation to an inactive Ti(III) species, which is retarded by immobilization. In addn., s(FI)Ti catalyzes trimerization α-olefins with high selectivity. Based on regioisomer distributions, catalysis by s(FI)Ti involves the same active species as the previously reported homogeneous systems (FI)TiR_2Me/B(C_6F_5)_3(R = Me, CH_2SiMe_3, CH_2CMe_3). Co-supporting the (FI)TiCl_3 catalyst with the ethylene polymn. catalyst (CpSiNR)TiCl_2 (CpSiNR = (C_5Me_4)SiMe_2NCMe_3), either on sep. or the same silica particles, affords a catalyst system for producing butyl-branched LLDPE from and ethylene-only feed.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251645","docid":251645,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252789","fileid":1252789,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251645,"filename":"Bercaw_2017pPMSE-279.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"fe1ba332da86d9406b7cbe81e1bc253a","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":122837,"mtime":"2017-05-03 16:30:36","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77141/1/Bercaw_2017pPMSE-279.pdf"}],"eprintid":77141,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Bercaw_2017pPMSE-279.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77141,"rev_number":8,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/41","datestamp":"2017-05-03 18:16:39","lastmod":"2017-05-03 18:16:39","status_changed":"2017-05-03 18:16:39","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"John E.","family":"Bercaw","id":"Bercaw-J-E","orcid":""},{"given":"Dinesh","family":"Aluthge","id":"Aluthge-D-C","orcid":""},{"given":"Aaron","family":"Sattler","id":"Sattler-A","orcid":""},{"given":"Jay A.","family":"Labinger","id":"Labinger-J-A","orcid":"0000-0002-1942-9232"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"PMSE-279","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-093030667","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-093030667","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
