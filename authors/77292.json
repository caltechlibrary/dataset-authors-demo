{"title":"X-ray Intraday Variability of Five TeV Blazars with NuSTAR","uri":"","abstract":"We have examined 40 NuSTAR light curves (LCs) of five TeV emitting high\nsynchrotron peaked blazars: 1ES 0229+200, Mrk 421, Mrk 501, 1ES 1959+650 and\nPKS 2155-304. Four of the blazars showed intraday variability in the NuSTAR\nenergy range of 3-79 keV. Using an auto correlation function analysis we\nsearched for intraday variability timescales in these LCs and found indications\nof several between 2.5 and 32.8 ks in eight LCs of Mrk 421, a timescale around\n8.0 ks for one LC of Mrk 501, and timescales of 29.6 ks and 57.4 ks in two LCs\nof PKS 2155-304. The other two blazars' LCs do not show any evidence for\nintraday variability timescales shorter than the lengths of those observations,\nhowever, the data was both sparser and noisier, for them. We found positive\ncorrelations with zero lag between soft (3-10 keV) and hard (10-79 keV) bands\nfor most of the LCs, indicating that their emissions originate from the same\nelectron population. We examined spectral variability using a hardness ratio\nanalysis and noticed a general \"harder-when-brighter\" behavior. The 22 LCs of\nMrk 421 observed between July 2012 and April 2013 show that this source was in\na quiescent state for an extended period of time and then underwent an\nunprecedented double peaked outburst while monitored on a daily basis during 10\n- 16 April 2013. We briefly discuss models capable of explaining these blazar\nemissions.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251951","docid":251951,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255515","fileid":1255515,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251951,"filename":"1705.02719.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"5ecc889f956f909f457cf7fb90d92080","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":5181686,"mtime":"2017-05-09 16:36:22","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77292/1/1705.02719.pdf"}],"eprintid":77292,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1705.02719.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"We thank the anonymous referee for important comments,\nwhich helped us to improve the manuscript.\nACG is partially supported by the Chinese Academy of\nSciences (CAS) Presidentâ€™s International Fellowship Initiative\n(PIFI) (grant no. 2016VMB073).
