{"title":"Classification of continuously transitive circle groups","uri":"","abstract":"Let G be a closed transitive subgroup of Homeo(S^1) which contains a non-constant continuous path f:[0,1]→G. We show that up to conjugation G is one of the following groups: SO(2,ℝ), PSL(2,ℝ), PSL_k(2,ℝ), Homeo_k(S^1), Homeo(S^1). This verifies the classification suggested by Ghys in [Enseign. Math. 47 (2001) 329-407]. As a corollary we show that the group PSL(2,ℝ) is a maximal closed subgroup of Homeo(S^1) (we understand this is a conjecture of de la Harpe). We also show that if such a group G\u003cHomeo(S^1) acts continuously transitively on k–tuples of points, k\u003e3, then the closure of G is Homeo(S^1) (cf Bestvina’s collection of ‘Questions in geometric group theory’)","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251898","docid":251898,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255097","fileid":1255097,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251898,"filename":"gt-v10-n3-p03-p.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"7b6a46ab16eaf8189d1a414485186d55","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":291877,"mtime":"2017-05-08 20:03:00","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77260/1/gt-v10-n3-p03-p.pdf"}],"eprintid":77260,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"gt-v10-n3-p03-p.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251899","docid":251899,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255099","fileid":1255099,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251899,"filename":"0903.0180.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"3796f93e2beef0a46473fc73059ce9f2","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":279268,"mtime":"2017-05-08 20:03:07","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77260/2/0903.0180.pdf"}],"eprintid":77260,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0903.0180.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2006 Mathematical Sciences Publishers.\n\nReceived: 12 December 2005;\nRevised: 22 June 2006;\nAccepted: 29 July 2006;\nPublished: 18 September 2006.\n\n","id":77260,"rev_number":9,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/72/60","datestamp":"2017-05-09 23:04:52","lastmod":"2017-05-09 23:04:52","status_changed":"2017-05-09 23:04:52","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"James","family":"Giblin","id":"Giblin-J","orcid":""},{"given":"Vladimir","family":"Markovic","id":"Markovic-V","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"Circle group, convergence group, transitive group, cyclic cover","date":"2006-09-18","date_type":"published","publication":"Geometry and Topology","volume":"10","number":"3","pagerange":"1319-1346","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170508-130256247","refereed":true,"issn":"1465-3060","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170508-130256247","related_url":[{"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2140/gt.2006.10.1319","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://msp.org/gt/2006/10-3/p03.xhtml","type":"pub","description":"Article"},{"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0180","type":"arxiv","description":"Discussion Paper"}],"referencetext":["[1] M Bestvina, Questions in geometric group theory, collected by M Bestvina at\nhttp://www.math.utah.edu/~bestvina\n[2] A Casson, D Jungreis, Convergence groups and Seifert fibered 3-manifolds, Invent.\nMath. 118 (1994) 441–456 MR1296353\n[3] D Gabai, Convergence groups are Fuchsian groups, Ann. of Math. .2/ 136 (1992)\n447–510 MR1189862\n[4] FW Gehring, GJ Martin, Discrete quasiconformal groups.
