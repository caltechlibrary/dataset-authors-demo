{"title":"Holographic grating formation in silver nanoparticle suspensions","uri":"","abstract":"Thermal gratings are recorded in silver nanoparticle suspensions by nanosecond pulsed holography. Initial transients in diffraction efficiency demonstrate competing effects in grating formation. The grating's final decay is consistent with the suspension's thermal conductivity.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251919","docid":251919,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255329","fileid":1255329,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251919,"filename":"04627575.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"b864da0b56fa8cd50693590e722c7084","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":425922,"mtime":"2017-05-08 23:45:11","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77192/1/04627575.pdf"}],"eprintid":77192,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04627575.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2006 Optical Society of America. \n\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from Deutsche Telekom AG, the DFS, and the DARPA Center for Optofluidic Integration.","id":77192,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/92","datestamp":"2017-05-16 20:25:28","lastmod":"2017-05-16 20:25:28","status_changed":"2017-05-16 20:25:28","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"James R.","family":"Adleman","id":"Adleman-J-R","orcid":""},{"given":"Helge","family":"Eggert","id":"Eggert-H-A","orcid":""},{"given":"Karsten","family":"Buse","id":"Buse-K","orcid":""},{"given":"Demetri","family":"Psaltis","id":"Psaltis-D","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-05","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"Paper CFA7","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170504-094609688","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170504-094609688","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=cleo-2006-CFA7","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"J.
