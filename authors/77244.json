{"title":"Harmonic diffeomorphisms and conformal distortion of Riemann surfaces","uri":"","abstract":"In this paper we study the change of conformal structure induced by harmonic diffeomorphisms between Riemann surfaces. The main result of this paper is to answer the following question raised by R. Schoen (see [20]): Is it true that Riemann surfaces which are related by a surjective harmonic diffeomorphism are necessarily\nquasiconformally related? We show that there exists a pair of Riemann surfaces of infinite topological type, which are related by a surjective harmonic diffeomorphism but which are not quasiconformally related. Also we characterize when the above question has a positive answer in the case of Riemann surfaces of finite topological type.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251869","docid":251869,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254906","fileid":1254906,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251869,"filename":"CAG-2002-0010-0004-a007.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"ebb5ebe77762d73b6ec7b3f4daa40630","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":762146,"mtime":"2017-05-05 23:06:04","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77244/1/CAG-2002-0010-0004-a007.pdf"}],"eprintid":77244,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"CAG-2002-0010-0004-a007.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2002 International Press. \n\nReceived November 15, 2000.","id":77244,"rev_number":7,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/72/44","datestamp":"2017-05-05 23:12:52","lastmod":"2017-05-05 23:12:52","status_changed":"2017-05-05 23:12:52","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Vladimir","family":"Markovic","id":"Markovic-V","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2002","date_type":"published","publication":"Communications in Analysis and Geometry ","volume":"10","number":"4","pagerange":"847-876","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170505-160559819","refereed":true,"issn":"1019-8385 ","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170505-160559819","related_url":[{"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4310/CAG.2002.v10.n4.a7","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/cag/content/vols/0010/0004/a007/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[1] L.
