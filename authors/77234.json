{"title":"Teichmüller mapping class group of the universal hyperbolic solenoid","uri":"","abstract":"We show that the homotopy class of a quasiconformal self-map of the universal hyperbolic solenoid H_∞ is the same as its isotopy class and that the uniform convergence of quasiconformal self-maps of H_∞ to the identity forces them to be homotopic to conformal maps. We identify a dense subset of T(H_∞) such that the orbit under the base leaf preserving mapping class group MCG_(BLP)(H_∞) of any point in this subset has accumulation points in the Teichmüller space T(H_∞). Moreover, we show that finite subgroups of  MCG_(BLP)(H_∞) are necessarily cyclic and that each point of T(H_∞) has an infinite isotropy subgroup in MCG_(BLP)(H_∞).","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251834","docid":251834,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254598","fileid":1254598,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251834,"filename":"S0002-9947-05-03823-7.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"647302fa2556f0bd77ada5cabe4d00eb","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":238695,"mtime":"2017-05-05 20:59:58","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77234/1/S0002-9947-05-03823-7.pdf"}],"eprintid":77234,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"S0002-9947-05-03823-7.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252379","docid":252379,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1258877","fileid":1258877,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252379,"filename":"MS.ps","mime_type":"application/postscript","hash":"967aa3c3fef49ecee5ff4d24d2a370c1","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":177958,"mtime":"2017-05-17 19:43:04","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77234/2/MS.ps"}],"eprintid":77234,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/postscript","format":"application/postscript","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"MS.ps","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2005 American Mathematical Society. \n\nReceived by the editors July 22, 2004.
