{"title":"Dynamic molecular oxygen production in cometary comae","uri":"","abstract":"Abundant molecular oxygen was discovered in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Its origin was ascribed to primordial gaseous O_2 incorporated into the nucleus during the comet’s formation. This thesis was put forward after discounting several O_2 production mechanisms in comets, including photolysis and radiolysis of water, solar wind–surface interactions and gas-phase collisions. Here we report an original Eley–Rideal reaction mechanism, which permits direct O_2 formation in single collisions of energetic water ions with oxidized cometary surface analogues. The reaction proceeds by H_2O+ abstracting a surface O-atom, then forming an excited precursor state, which dissociates to produce O_2−. Subsequent photo-detachment leads to molecular O_2, whose presence in the coma may thus be linked directly to water molecules and their interaction with the solar wind. This abiotic O_2 production mechanism is consistent with reported trends in the 67P coma and raises awareness of the role of energetic negative ions in comets.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251876","docid":251876,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254965","fileid":1254965,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251876,"filename":"ncomms15298.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"879df41677e8908ceab96e7311ecbe2c","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":499948,"mtime":"2017-05-08 14:52:17","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77245/1/ncomms15298.pdf"}],"eprintid":77245,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"ncomms15298.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251877","docid":251877,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254971","fileid":1254971,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251877,"filename":"ncomms15298-s1.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"0a427e992a289bce7d300f23d5bde9d1","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":3089292,"mtime":"2017-05-08 14:55:48","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77245/2/ncomms15298-s1.pdf"}],"eprintid":77245,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"ncomms15298-s1.pdf","content":"supplemental"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251878","docid":251878,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254975","fileid":1254975,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251878,"filename":"ncomms15298-s2.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"83a755cdfac9a71f68201365676d28f6","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":378472,"mtime":"2017-05-08 14:56:11","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77245/3/ncomms15298-s2.pdf"}],"eprintid":77245,"pos":3,"placement":3,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"ncomms15298-s2.pdf","content":"supplemental"}],"note":"© 2017 The Author(s).
