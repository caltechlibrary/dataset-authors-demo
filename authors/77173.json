{"title":"Mechanistic turn in inorganic textbooks: Basolo and Pearson's Mechanisms of Inorganic Reactions","uri":"","abstract":"Widespread interest in mechanistic work among Inorg. chemists did not really appear until the 1950s, considerably later than for their org. colleagues. Ronald Nyholm and others have identified a mid-century\n\"renaissance\" of inorg. chem., and the turn towards mechanism played a major part in that development. I will\ndiscuss the central role of Fred Basolo and Ralph Pearson's 1958 monograph \"Mechanisms of Inorg. Reactions\" in influencing that turn, based upon a combined horizontal and vertical sampling of inorg. textbooks around that period.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251686","docid":251686,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1253207","fileid":1253207,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251686,"filename":"Labinger_2017pCINF-41.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"c562140e814c1d52bf286a22cd3864bb","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":88764,"mtime":"2017-05-03 22:23:39","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77173/1/Labinger_2017pCINF-41.pdf"}],"eprintid":77173,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Labinger_2017pCINF-41.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77173,"rev_number":8,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/73","datestamp":"2017-05-04 01:29:09","lastmod":"2017-05-04 01:29:09","status_changed":"2017-05-04 01:29:09","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Jay A.","family":"Labinger","id":"Labinger-J-A","orcid":"0000-0002-1942-9232"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"CINF-41","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-152332686","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-152332686","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
