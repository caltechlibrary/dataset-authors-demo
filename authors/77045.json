{"title":"Sewers’ diffusion and the decline of mortality: The case of Paris, 1880–1914","uri":"","abstract":"It is common to argue that water infrastructure innovations improve life expectancy. Yet the benefits of clean water depend on a mechanism to dispose of waste water. We draw on the historical experience of a large industrial city to estimate the impact of the spread of the sewer system. Using a longitudinal data set on mortality and rents for each of Paris’ 80 neighborhoods we show that sanitation contributed several years to life expectancy. These results point out the multiplicity of infrastructure needed to help decrease mortality.","documents":null,"note":"© 2016 Elsevier Inc. \n\nReceived 8 July 2014, Revised 11 February 2016, Accepted 6 March 2016, Available online 26 March 2016. \n\nThe authors would like to thank Leah Brooks, David Canning, Jonathan Chapman, Tracy Dennison, Edward Glaeser, Timothy Guinnane, Philip Hoffman, Samantha Myers, Jim Oeppen, Paul Rhode, Paula Scott, William Summerhill and the participants at seminars at All-UC Huntington conference, INED, Michigan, PAA annual conference, PSE, Stanford, UCLA, Université Paris-Dauphine, University of Pennsylvania and Yale for helpful comments.","id":77045,"rev_number":5,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/70/45","datestamp":"2017-04-28 15:56:42","lastmod":"2017-04-28 15:56:42","status_changed":"2017-04-28 15:56:42","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Lionel","family":"Kesztenbaum","id":"Kesztenbaum-L","orcid":""},{"given":"Jean-Laurent","family":"Rosenthal","id":"Rosenthal-J-L","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-03","date_type":"published","publication":"Journal of Urban Economics","volume":"98","number":"","pagerange":"174-186","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170428-083320712","refereed":true,"issn":"0094-1190","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170428-083320712","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2016.03.001","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119016000139","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"Lionel Kesztenbaum, Jean-Laurent Rosenthal, Sewers’ diffusion and the decline of mortality: The case of Paris, 1880–1914, Journal of Urban Economics, Volume 98, March 2017, Pages 174-186, ISSN 0094-1190, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2016.03.001.\n(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119016000139)","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
