{"title":"Distributed LQR Design for Dynamically Decoupled Systems","uri":"","abstract":"We consider a set of identical decoupled dynamical systems and a control problem where the performance index couples the behavior of the systems. The coupling is described through a communication graph where each system is a node and the control action at each node is only function of its state and the states of its neighbors. A distributed control design method is presented which requires the solution of a single LQR problem. The size of the LQR problem is equal to the maximum vertex degree of the communication graph plus one. The design procedure proposed in this paper illustrates how stability of the large-scale system is related to the robustness of local controllers and the spectrum of a matrix representing the sparsity pattern of the distributed controller design problem.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251625","docid":251625,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252634","fileid":1252634,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251625,"filename":"04177426.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"1e4aeddf8ab15687a429482ad1e081e9","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":223651,"mtime":"2017-05-03 00:32:50","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77135/1/04177426.pdf"}],"eprintid":77135,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04177426.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE.","id":77135,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/35","datestamp":"2017-05-03 15:43:37","lastmod":"2017-05-03 15:43:37","status_changed":"2017-05-03 15:43:37","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Francesco","family":"Borrelli","id":"Borrelli-F","orcid":""},{"given":"Tamás","family":"Keviczky","id":"Keviczky-T","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-12","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"5639-5644","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170502-173007416","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170502-173007416","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2006.377294","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4177426/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["1]   S.
