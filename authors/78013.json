{"title":"Synthesis of Symmetrical Trisubstituted Olefins by Cross Metathesis","uri":"","abstract":"Trisubstituted alkenes have been prepared via intermolecular olefin cross-metathesis (CM) between α-olefins and symmetrically 1,1-disubstituted olefins using an imidazolylidene ruthenium benzylidene complex. Of particular interest is the synthesis of isoprenoid/prenyl groups by a simple solvent-free CM reaction with isobutylene. In addition, prenyl groups can also be installed by a cross-metathesis of 2-methyl-2-butene with a variety of α-olefins at room temperature with low catalyst loadings.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253356","docid":253356,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1267930","fileid":1267930,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253356,"filename":"ol0259793.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"040026833c06b86880900669122463c7","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":56535,"mtime":"2017-06-07 21:29:42","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/78013/1/ol0259793.pdf"}],"eprintid":78013,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"ol0259793.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2002 American Chemical Society. \n\nReceived April 5, 2002.

The bottle was capped with a rubber septum and flushed with dry nitrogen and cooled to −78 °C (or temperature sufficient to freeze substrate). Substrate (1.0 mmol) was injected into the bottle. Once the substrate was frozen, a pressure regulator was attached to the bottle. The bottle was evacuated and backfilled with dry nitrogen 3 times. Subsequently, isobutylene (5−10 mL, 50−100 equiv) was condensed into the bottle. The bottle was backfilled to ∼2 psi with nitrogen, sealed, and allowed to slowly warm to room temperature, at which time it was transferred to an oil bath at 40 °C. After stirring for 12−18 h, the bottle was removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to room temperature. The isobutylene was slowly vented off at room temperature until the pressure apparatus could be safely disassembled. The remaining mixture was taken up in organic solvent for subsequent silica gel chromatography and/or spectrographic characterization.OpenURL CALIFORNIA INST OF TECHNOLOGY\n(13) The following paper provides an excellent application of the methods described in this Letter in an allyl to prenyl conversion, see:  Spessard, S.

Co. and 2-methyl-2-butene (3.2 mL) from Aldrich Chem. Co. were added simultaneously via syringe to a stirring solution of catalyst 3 (1.25 mg, 0.015 mmol, 1.0 mol %) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The flask was allowed to stir at room temperature for 12 h. The reaction mixture was then reduced in volume to 0.5 mL and purified directly on a silica gel column (2 × 10 cm), eluting with 20:1 hexane:ethyl acetate to provide the cross-metathesis product (316 mg, 1.337 mmol, 91% yield) as a viscous oil.OpenURL CALIFORNIA INST OF TECHNOLOGY\n(15) Thermodynamically controlled disproportionation of 2-methyl-2-butene and the step-growth ADMET polymerization of 2-methyl-1,5-hexadiene have been reported with 1:  Konzelman, J.; Wagener, K.
