{"title":"Using Caltech's institutional repository to track OA publishing in chemistry","uri":"","abstract":"In 2013, the faculty of Caltech adopted an Open Access policy applying to all faculty publications, which reserves rights on behalf of the author and the Institute. Caltech's institutional repository, the Caltech Collection of Open Digital Archives (CODA), has been instrumental in leveraging the Institute's policy as well as facilitating faculty to comply with OA policies imposed by external funding agencies. Several prominent chem. publishers have instituted Open Access options for authors publishing in their journals. This talk will describe Caltech's OA policy as well as CODA's role in both leveraging the Caltech policy and assisting Caltech faculty with funding and publishing compliance. Data on OA adoption for Caltech authors of chem. publications, compiled using CODA, will also be presented and discussed.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251682","docid":251682,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1253172","fileid":1253172,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251682,"filename":"Wrublewski_2017pCINF-135.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"21217ca748b0782c4efe3878071280ce","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":89564,"mtime":"2017-05-03 21:51:49","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77169/1/Wrublewski_2017pCINF-135.pdf"}],"eprintid":77169,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Wrublewski_2017pCINF-135.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77169,"rev_number":8,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/69","datestamp":"2017-05-04 01:32:17","lastmod":"2017-05-04 01:32:17","status_changed":"2017-05-04 01:32:17","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Donna","family":"Wrublewski","id":"Wrublewski-D-T","orcid":"0000-0003-0248-0813"},{"given":"George S.","family":"Porter","id":"Porter-G-S","orcid":"0000-0002-6539-638X"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"CINF-135","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-145143324","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-145143324","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
