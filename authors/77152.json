{"title":"Solar fuels science","uri":"","abstract":"We and many others are designing solar-driven mol. machines that could be used on a global scale to store solar energy by splitting water into its elemental components. We are investigating the structures and mechanisms of hydrogen evolving catalysts made from Earth abundant elements such as cobalt, iron, and nickel. We also are employing pulsed laser ablation in water for synthesis of robust oxygen evolving catalysts. To aid our research, we have recruited hundreds of students to join a Solar Army whose mission is the discovery of new materials for the prodn. of solar fuels.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251654","docid":251654,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252857","fileid":1252857,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251654,"filename":"Gray_2017pINOR-194.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"6fa3c76022ff7a23c6e143b492369111","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":85163,"mtime":"2017-05-03 17:42:47","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77152/1/Gray_2017pINOR-194.pdf"}],"eprintid":77152,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Gray_2017pINOR-194.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77152,"rev_number":8,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/52","datestamp":"2017-05-03 18:08:47","lastmod":"2017-05-03 18:08:47","status_changed":"2017-05-03 18:08:47","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Harry B.","family":"Gray","id":"Gray-H-B","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"INOR-194","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-104240786","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-104240786","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":["CCI Solar Fuels"]}
