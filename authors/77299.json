{"title":"High throughput discovery of solar fuels photoanodes","uri":"","abstract":"The High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) project of the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis performs accelerated discovery of earth-abundant photoelectrocatalysts and other solar fuels materials. The HTE materials discovery framework integrates experimentation with materials theory and has recently been deployed for the identification of several new classes of metal oxide photoelectrocatalysts for the oxygen\nevolution reaction. Through compilation and inspection of these discoveries, relationships among compn., structure, electronic structure, stability, photoactivity, band gap energy, etc. are being identified, providing a deeper understanding of the known materials and enabling the design of new photoanode materials. In addn. to introducing the materials discovery pipeline, I will survey our recent discoveries and highlight the most pertinent lessons learned for developing metal oxide photoanodes.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251961","docid":251961,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255584","fileid":1255584,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251961,"filename":"Gregoire_2017pCATL-260.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"9964ecd75075be7d522128c10ef8383b","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":232409,"mtime":"2017-05-09 17:38:06","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77299/1/Gregoire_2017pCATL-260.pdf"}],"eprintid":77299,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Gregoire_2017pCATL-260.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77299,"rev_number":9,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/72/99","datestamp":"2017-05-12 23:16:43","lastmod":"2017-05-12 23:16:43","status_changed":"2017-05-12 23:16:43","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"John","family":"Gregoire","id":"Gregoire-J-M","orcid":"0000-0002-2863-5265"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"CATL-260","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170509-103759935","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170509-103759935","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":["JCAP"]}
