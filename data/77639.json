{"title":"Fractional biorthogonal partners and application in signal interpolation","uri":"","abstract":"The concept of biorthogonal partners has been introduced recently by the authors. The work presented in this paper is an extension of some of these results to the case where the upsampling and downsampling ratios are not integers but rational numbers. Hence the name fractional biorthogonal partners. The conditions for the existence of stable and of FIR fractional biorthogonal partners are derived. This result gives rise to an all-FIR spline interpolation technique with the minimum amount of required oversampling. This technique is illustrated by an interpolation example.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252574","docid":252574,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261569","fileid":1261569,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252574,"filename":"01010375.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"48a973f13f97dc355362d610928d2082","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":277124,"mtime":"2017-05-22 23:27:27","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77639/1/01010375.pdf"}],"eprintid":77639,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01010375.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2002 IEEE. \n\nWork supported in part by the ONR grant N00014-99-1-1002, USA.
