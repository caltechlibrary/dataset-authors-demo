We show that for every є \u003e 0 there are finite degree unbranched covers Sє → S and Rє → R, such that the Weil-Petersson distance between Sє and Rє is less than є in the corresponding Moduli space.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251927","docid":251927,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255384","fileid":1255384,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251927,"filename":"0806.2304.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"0b89b4aa1b39409821574c355747502f","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":797762,"mtime":"2017-05-09 13:36:17","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77279/1/0806.2304.pdf"}],"eprintid":77279,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0806.2304.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"(Submitted on 13 Jun 2008)","id":77279,"rev_number":8,"userid":772,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/72/79","datestamp":"2017-05-16 20:07:15","lastmod":"2017-05-16 20:07:15","status_changed":"2017-05-16 20:07:15","type":"monograph","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Jeremy","family":"Kahn","id":"Kahn-J","orcid":""},{"given":"Vladimir","family":"Markovic","id":"Markovic-V","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"submitted","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2008-06-13","date_type":"submitted","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170509-063604347","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170509-063604347","related_url":[{"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2304","type":"arxiv","description":"Discussion paper"}],"referencetext":["[1] L.
