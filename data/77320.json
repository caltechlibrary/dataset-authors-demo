{"title":"Existence, Uniqueness, and Optimality of Sibling-Property Codes for Infinite Sources","uri":"","abstract":"By definition Huffman codes only exist for finite sources, since the Huffman algorithm cannot be applied to an infinite source. On the other hand, Gallager's sibling property, which was introduced as a characterization of Huffman codes, extends naturally to (countably) infinite sources. Thus we define a Huffman-Gallager code as any code that has the sibling property, and we present some basic facts about such codes. (1) For any source, a Huffman-Gallager code exists and its list of node probabilities is unique. (2) A Huffman-Gallager code is optimal, and given an optimal code, there exists a Huffman-Gallager code with the same codeword lengths. (3) For sources with infinite entropy, the existence and uniqueness results continue to hold, and the optimality results hold for a natural extended form of optimality.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251992","docid":251992,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255846","fileid":1255846,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251992,"filename":"04036429.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"1978f7ed1f25b57ba2e5ce01afb80b33","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":159657,"mtime":"2017-05-10 00:13:41","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77320/1/04036429.pdf"}],"eprintid":77320,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04036429.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE.","id":77320,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/73/20","datestamp":"2017-05-16 20:56:59","lastmod":"2017-05-16 20:56:59","status_changed":"2017-05-16 20:56:59","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Matthew","family":"Klimesh","id":"Klimesh-M","orcid":""},{"given":"Robert J.","family":"McEliece","id":"McEliece-R-J","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-07","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"2536-2540","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170509-170830648","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170509-170830648","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.262089","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4036429/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["1]  D.
