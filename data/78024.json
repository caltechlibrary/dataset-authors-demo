{"title":"The Role of Silicon in the Color of Gem Corundum","uri":"","abstract":"Natural corundum is colored by a variety of trace-element impurities and by the chemical reactions among them. Important to nearly all of the colors is the role played by the reactions among silicon, titanium, and magnesium. Characterization of the interactions between these aliovalent ions has been hindered by the fact that the laser ablation–inductively coupled quadrupole–mass spectrometry equipment used in most gem labs does not resolve the interferences for silicon. Thus Si has not been measured at relevant concentrations. Recent development of ion implant standards and the application of secondary ion mass spectrometry has allowed the accurate measurement of silicon in corundum for the first time. As an example of its importance, detailed analyses of sapphire from Montana’s Yogo Gulch deposit are presented. These analyses show that without silicon, Yogo sapphire would not be blue.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253378","docid":253378,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1268080","fileid":1268080,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253378,"filename":"Emmett_2017p42.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"81159fa181fcdacc02317c634214710a","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1726585,"mtime":"2017-06-08 15:02:52","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/78024/1/Emmett_2017p42.pdf"}],"eprintid":78024,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Emmett_2017p42.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2017 Gemological Institute of America. \n\nTom Moses and GIA have provided long-term support for numerous studies like this one. Tim Thomas initiated GIA’s development of the new set matrix-matched standards on which this work depends.
