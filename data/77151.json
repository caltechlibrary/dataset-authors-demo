{"title":"Selective catalytic trimerization of alkenes","uri":"","abstract":"The selective trimerization of ethylene constitutes a useful source of 1-hexene, an important co-monomer for\nthe prodn. of linear low-d. polyethylene (LLDPE), while selective trimerization of α-olefins could lead to new\nmethodol. for upgrading light hydrocarbons to more valuable fuels and lubricants. I will discuss several aspects\nof Cr- and Ti-catalyzed trimerization studied by our group, including: 1) a diagnostic test for the metallacyclebased\nmechanism proposed to account for selectivity; 2) spectroscopic evidence that a very small fraction of\ntotal species is responsible for activity with a Cr-based catalyst; 3) a stoichiometrically activated, homogeneous\nTi-based catalyst that both permits detailed mechanistic study for ethylene trimerization and is active for α-\nolefin trimerization; 4) a supported version of the Ti catalyst that gives significantly improved performance;\nand 5) a co-supported tandem catalyst for LLDPE prodn. using ethylene as the sole feed.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251653","docid":251653,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252850","fileid":1252850,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251653,"filename":"Labinger_2017pINOR-604.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"75748ed7fb40b67202caacdfeb67fdc6","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":121412,"mtime":"2017-05-03 17:41:23","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77151/1/Labinger_2017pINOR-604.pdf"}],"eprintid":77151,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Labinger_2017pINOR-604.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77151,"rev_number":8,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/51","datestamp":"2017-05-03 18:09:31","lastmod":"2017-05-03 18:09:31","status_changed":"2017-05-03 18:09:31","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Jay A.","family":"Labinger","id":"Labinger-J-A","orcid":"0000-0002-1942-9232"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"INOR-604","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-104116718","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-104116718","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
