{"title":"3D nano-architected metallic glass: Size effect suppresses catastrophic failure","uri":"","abstract":"We investigate the mechanical behavior of 3D periodically architected metallic glass nanolattices, constructed from hollow beams of sputtered Zr-Ni-Al metallic glass. Nanolattices composed of beams with different wall thicknesses are fabricated by varying the sputter deposition time, resulting in nanolattices with median wall thicknesses of ∼88 nm, ∼57 nm, ∼38 nm, ∼30 nm, ∼20 nm, and ∼10 nm. Uniaxial compression experiments conducted inside a scanning electron microscope reveal a transition from brittle, catastrophic failure in thicker-walled nanolattices (median wall thicknesses of ∼88 and ∼57 nm) to deformable, gradual, layer-by-layer collapse in thinner-walled nanolattices (median wall thicknesses of ∼38 nm and less). As the nanolattice wall thickness is varied, large differences in deformability are manifested through the severity of strain bursts, nanolattice recovery after compression, and in-situ images obtained during compression experiments. We explain the brittle-to-deformable transition that occurs as the nanolattice wall thickness decreases in terms of the “smaller is more deformable” material size effect that arises in nano-sized metallic glasses. This work demonstrates that the nano-induced failure-suppression size effect that emerges in small-scale metallic glasses can be proliferated to larger-scale materials by the virtue of architecting.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252819","docid":252819,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263707","fileid":1263707,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252819,"filename":"1-s2.0-S1359645417303968-main.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"db73dd9eeaed406f2cbcee16512fbc15","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":5686024,"mtime":"2017-05-26 15:48:21","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77795/1/1-s2.0-S1359645417303968-main.pdf"}],"eprintid":77795,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1-s2.0-S1359645417303968-main.pdf","content":"accepted"}],"note":"© 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.
