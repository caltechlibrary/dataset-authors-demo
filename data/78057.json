{"title":"Numerical computations of coarsening in the one-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard model of phase separation","uri":"","abstract":"Time dependent solutions of the Cahn-Hilliard equation are studied numerically. In particular heteroclinic orbits, which connect different equilibrium solutions at t = -∞ and t = +∞, are sought. Thus boundary value problems in space-time are computed. This computation requires an investigation of the stability of equilibria, since projections onto the stable and unstable manifolds determine the boundary conditions at t = -∞ and t = +∞. This stability analysis is then followed by solution of the appropriate boundary value problem in space-time. The results obtained cannot be found by standard initial value simulations. By specifying the two steady states at t = ±∞ appropriately it is possible to find orbits reflecting a given degree of coarsening over the time evolution. This gives a clear picture of the dynamic coarsening admissible in the equation. It also provides an understanding of orbits on the global attractor for the equation.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253438","docid":253438,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1268482","fileid":1268482,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253438,"filename":"1-s2.0-0167278994901120-main.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"84069864aaa50e189fcb827b3ba37ecc","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":704156,"mtime":"2017-06-09 19:28:15","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/78057/1/1-s2.0-0167278994901120-main.pdf"}],"eprintid":78057,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"1-s2.0-0167278994901120-main.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 1994 Elsevier B.V. \n\nReceived 29 September 1993, Revised 1 May 1994. \n\nThe work of Bai and Spence is supported by the UK Science Engineering Research Council.
