{"title":"A practical approach for magnetic core-loss characterization","uri":"","abstract":"A practical approach for magnetic core loss characterization up to a few megahertz is presented. An error analysis is performed, revealing that corrections are needed to compensate for errors introduced by extra phase shifts inherent in a measurement setup, and by shunt parasitic capacitance associated with an inductive device under test. A simple technique is proposed to control the error, so as to satisfy prescribed tolerances. Extensive meassurements done on a TDK PC40 core yield results which support the analysis. Several sample cores are then characterized at a few megahertz.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252916","docid":252916,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1264708","fileid":1264708,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252916,"filename":"00290722.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"91b4f855cbcd8c54e18e8615ac2336b9","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":573444,"mtime":"2017-05-31 00:49:13","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77842/1/00290722.pdf"}],"eprintid":77842,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00290722.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 1993 IEEE. \n\nThis work was supported by the Missile Systems Group, Hughes \nAircraft Co., Canoga Park, California.","id":77842,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/78/42","datestamp":"2017-05-31 18:55:05","lastmod":"2017-05-31 18:55:05","status_changed":"2017-05-31 18:55:05","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"F.
