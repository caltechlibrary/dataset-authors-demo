{"title":"Millimeter and submillimeter spectrum of propylene oxide","uri":"","abstract":"The spectrum of propylene oxide was collected from 70 GHz to 1 THz using direct absorption millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy. Analysis of the spectrum was performed using the SPFIT/SPCAT programs for the A state. A full internal rotor analysis was performed using the XIAM program. The barrier to internal rotation of the methyl group was determined to be 893 cm^(−1). The precision of the rotation constants, centrifugal distortion constants, and internal rotor parameters was increased over the results reported by previous low-frequency studies. The results of this laboratory study and the associated analysis, as well as a spectral prediction for the ground vibrational state of propylene oxide, are presented.","documents":null,"note":"© 2017 Elsevier Inc. \n\nReceived 13 December 2016, Revised 30 January 2017, Accepted 6 February 2017, Available online 8 February 2017.\n","id":77882,"rev_number":5,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/78/82","datestamp":"2017-06-01 21:00:29","lastmod":"2017-06-01 21:00:29","status_changed":"2017-06-01 21:00:29","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"A.
