{"title":"The status of DECIGO","uri":"","abstract":"DECIGO (DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory) is the planned Japanese space gravitational wave antenna, aiming to detect gravitational waves from astrophysically and cosmologically significant sources mainly between 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz and thus to open a new window for gravitational wave astronomy and for the universe. DECIGO will consists of three drag-free spacecraft arranged in an equilateral triangle with 1000 km arm lengths whose relative displacements are measured by a differential Fabry-Perot interferometer, and four units of triangular Fabry-Perot interferometers are arranged on heliocentric orbit around the sun. DECIGO is vary ambitious mission, we plan to launch DECIGO in era of 2030s after precursor satellite mission, B-DECIGO. B-DECIGO is essentially smaller version of DECIGO: B-DECIGO consists of three spacecraft arranged in an triangle with 100 km arm lengths orbiting 2000 km above the surface of the earth. It is hoped that the launch date will be late 2020s for the present.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253070","docid":253070,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265823","fileid":1265823,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253070,"filename":"Sato_2017_J._Phys.%3A_Conf._Ser._840_012010.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"1c2146d2aaa601567c03c9546a61afcf","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":2356455,"mtime":"2017-06-02 17:01:14","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77914/1/Sato_2017_J._Phys.%253A_Conf._Ser._840_012010.pdf"}],"eprintid":77914,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"Sato_2017_J._Phys.%3A_Conf._Ser._840_012010.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.
