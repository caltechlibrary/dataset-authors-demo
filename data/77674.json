{"title":"Guest editorial","uri":"","abstract":"A new paradigm has emerged, in which the band structure concepts of solid-state physics are applied to electromagnetics. This has led to a profusion of scientific creativity as new forms of electromagnetic crystal structures are invented for radio and microwaves, as well as for three-dimensional (3-D) geometry of both natural crystals and those artificial crystals that can arise only in the human imagination.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252630","docid":252630,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1262112","fileid":1262112,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252630,"filename":"00798000.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"76403c21d791ac50dd47869f9d5cd861","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":16358,"mtime":"2017-05-23 23:48:08","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77674/1/00798000.pdf"}],"eprintid":77674,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00798000.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 1999 IEEE.","id":77674,"rev_number":7,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/76/74","datestamp":"2017-05-24 00:07:32","lastmod":"2017-05-24 00:07:32","status_changed":"2017-05-24 00:07:32","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Axel","family":"Scherer","id":"Scherer-A","orcid":""},{"given":"Theodore","family":"Doll","id":"Doll-T","orcid":""},{"given":"Eli","family":"Yablonovitch","id":"Yablonovitch-E","orcid":""},{"given":"Henry","family":"Everitt","id":"Everitt-H-O","orcid":""},{"given":"Aiden","family":"Higgins","id":"Higgins-A","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"1999-11","date_type":"published","publication":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","volume":"47","number":"11","pagerange":"2057-2058","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170523-163435948","refereed":true,"issn":"0018-9480","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170523-163435948","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.1999.798000","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/798000/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["1]   J.
