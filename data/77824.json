{"title":"Unsupervised Discovery of El Niño Using Causal Feature Learning on Microlevel Climate Data","uri":"","abstract":"We show that the climate phenomena of El Niño and La Niña arise naturally as states of macro-variables when our recent causal feature learning framework (Chalupka et al., 2015, 2016) is applied to micro-level measures of zonal wind (ZW) and sea surface temperatures (SST) taken over the equatorial band of the Pacific Ocean. The method identifies these unusual climate states on the basis of the relation between ZW and SST patterns without any input about past occurrences of El Niño or La Niña. The simpler alternatives of (i) clustering the SST fields while disregarding their relationship with ZW patterns, or (ii) clustering the joint ZW-SST patterns, do not discover El Niño. We discuss the degree to which our method supports a causal interpretation and use a low-dimensional toy example to explain its success over other clustering approaches. Finally, we propose a new robust and scalable alternative to our original algorithm (Chalupka et al., 2016), which circumvents the need for high-dimensional density learning.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252868","docid":252868,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1264318","fileid":1264318,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252868,"filename":"1605.09370","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"35fd792c777e5cad8ff9494472197268","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":3648319,"mtime":"2017-05-30 16:40:35","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77824/1/1605.09370"}],"eprintid":77824,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1605.09370","content":"submitted"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252869","docid":252869,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1264321","fileid":1264321,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252869,"filename":"11.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"03594d966e226358e527e0aea3bc0ee8","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":3579511,"mtime":"2017-05-30 16:41:06","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77824/2/11.pdf"}],"eprintid":77824,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"11.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2016 AUAI Press. \n\nKC’s and PP’s work was supported by the ONR MURI grant N00014-10-1-0933 and Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.
