{"title":"Dark gauge bosons: LHC signatures of non-Abelian kinetic mixing","uri":"","abstract":"We consider non-abelian kinetic mixing between the Standard Model SU(2)_L and a dark sector U(1)′ gauge group associated with the presence of a scalar SU(2)_L triplet. The magnitude of the resulting dark photon coupling ϵ is determined by the ratio of the triplet vacuum expectation value, constrained to by ≲4 GeV by electroweak precision tests, to the scale Λ of the effective theory. The corresponding effective operator Wilson coefficient can be O(1) while accommodating null results for dark photon searches, allowing for a distinctive LHC dark photon phenomenology. After outlining the possible LHC signatures, we illustrate by recasting current ATLAS dark photon results into the non-abelian mixing context.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252820","docid":252820,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263717","fileid":1263717,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252820,"filename":"1-s2.0-S0370269317303118-main.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"7a689fe2da6a7269f83789ac54ab2cc1","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":443399,"mtime":"2017-05-26 16:02:35","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77797/1/1-s2.0-S0370269317303118-main.pdf"}],"eprintid":77797,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"1-s2.0-S0370269317303118-main.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252822","docid":252822,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263723","fileid":1263723,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252822,"filename":"1604.00044.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"e003bf5be120fcca315220586f59e477","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1178481,"mtime":"2017-05-26 16:06:21","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77797/2/1604.00044.pdf"}],"eprintid":77797,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1604.00044.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2017 The Authors.
