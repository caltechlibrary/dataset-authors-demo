{"title":"N-ethylformamide dimer. A β-turn model peptide in the gas phase","uri":"","abstract":"Reported here are CP-FTMW experiments on N-ethylformamide (NEF), previously studied by pure rotational spectroscopy in the gas phase by Hirota and co-workers (2005). Two conformers of the monomer (trans sc and cis ac), the trans-trans sc dimer, and several NEF-water complexes have been detected. (Only trans sc was observed in the earlier experiments.) Of these species, the trans-trans sc dimer is the most interesting since its three-dimensional structure bears a striking resemblance to β-turns in folded peptides. The well-known anti-parallel β-sheet structures would be expected to have near-zero dipole moments and are therefore discriminated against by the CP-FTMW method.","documents":null,"note":"© 2016 Elsevier Inc. \n\nReceived 1 September 2016, Revised 17 November 2016, Accepted 1 December 2016, Available online 9 December 2016.","id":77880,"rev_number":5,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/78/80","datestamp":"2017-06-01 21:12:54","lastmod":"2017-06-01 21:12:54","status_changed":"2017-06-01 21:12:54","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"V.","family":"Vaquero-Vara","id":"Vaquero-Vara-V","orcid":""},{"given":"V.","family":"Alstadt","id":"Alstadt-V","orcid":""},{"given":"T.
