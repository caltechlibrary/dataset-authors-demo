{"title":"Young engineering and science scholars (YESS) reaching outstanding students of limited opportunity","uri":"","abstract":" One reason there are under-represented groups in engineering and science is that many of these highly qualified students come from environments limiting their exposure and support for further study and careers. The YESS program targets students of excellent ability, from under-represented groups, from large urban schools and isolated rural schools with minimal opportunities, and parents with minimal education. Engineering Problem Solving skills are the basis of the in-depth work students do in engineering, physics, biology, and technology.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252633","docid":252633,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1262156","fileid":1262156,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252633,"filename":"00840412.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"499f8ccaad93143d18edb06ce07c1faf","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":39516,"mtime":"2017-05-24 00:08:31","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77677/1/00840412.pdf"}],"eprintid":77677,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00840412.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 1999 IEEE.","id":77677,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/76/77","datestamp":"2017-05-24 17:08:59","lastmod":"2017-05-24 17:08:59","status_changed":"2017-05-24 17:08:59","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Wayne","family":"Snyder","id":"Snyder-W","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"1999-11","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"3","number":"","pagerange":"","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170523-170543394","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170523-170543394","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.1999.840412","type":"doi","description":"Abstract"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/840412/","type":"pub","description":"Abstract"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"W.
