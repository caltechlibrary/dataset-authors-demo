{"title":"Lieb–Thirring inequalities on the half-line with critical exponent","uri":"","abstract":"We consider the operator -d^2/dr^2 - V in L_2(R_+) with Dirichlet boundary condition at the origin. For the moments of its negative eigenvalues we prove the bound tr (-d^2)/dr^2 -V)^y_- ≤ Cy,ɑʃ_(R+) (v(r)-1/_(4r)^2)^(y+(1+ɑ)/2_(r^ɑ dr) for any ɑ Є [0,1] and y ≥ (1 - ɑ)/2. This includes a Lieb–Thirring inequality in the critical endpoint case.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252969","docid":252969,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265089","fileid":1265089,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252969,"filename":"2008-010-003-06.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"d005f095375a321882e0f8236cb070a5","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":198583,"mtime":"2017-05-31 22:31:47","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77867/1/2008-010-003-06.pdf"}],"eprintid":77867,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"2008-010-003-06.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252970","docid":252970,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265091","fileid":1265091,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252970,"filename":"0611247.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"f0d429793d631f6c5c6f56aa1211abce","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":245001,"mtime":"2017-05-31 22:33:26","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77867/2/0611247.pdf"}],"eprintid":77867,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0611247.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2008 European Mathematical Society. \n\nReceived December 6, 2006 and in revised form January 22, 2007. \n\nThis work was partially supported by FCT Portugal, post-doc grant SFRH/BPD/23820/2005, (T.E.), by the Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research\nand Higher Education (STINT) (R.F.), as well as through the ESF Scientific Programme in Spectral Theory and Partial Differential Equations (SPECT).
