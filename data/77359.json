{"title":"Asymptotically Optimal Cooperative Wireless Networks without Constellation Expansion","uri":"","abstract":"In this work, we construct a unified family of cooperative diversity coding schemes for implementing the orthogonal amplify-and-forward and the orthogonal selection-decode-and-forward strategies in cooperative wireless networks. We show that, as the number of users increases, these schemes meet the corresponding optimal high-SNR outage region, and do so with minimal order of signaling complexity. This is an improvement over all outage-optimal schemes which impose exponential increases in signaling complexity for every new network user. Our schemes, which are based on commutative algebras of normal matrices, satisfy the outage-related information theoretic criteria, the duplex-related coding criteria, and maintain reduced signaling, encoding and decoding complexities.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252046","docid":252046,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256214","fileid":1256214,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252046,"filename":"04036469.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"df12a5cfd9dbf5ffda84a357f90a7b2f","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":431472,"mtime":"2017-05-11 00:30:29","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77359/1/04036469.pdf"}],"eprintid":77359,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04036469.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE. \n\nThe work of F.
