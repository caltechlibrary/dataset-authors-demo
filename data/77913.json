{"title":"The VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey first data release: Spectra and spectroscopic redshifts of 698 objects up to Z_(spec) ~ 6 in CANDELS","uri":"","abstract":"This paper describes the first data release (DR1) of the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS). The VUDS-DR1 is the release of all low-resolution spectroscopic data obtained in 276.9 arcmin^2 of the CANDELS-COSMOS and CANDELS-ECDFS survey areas, including accurate spectroscopic redshifts zspec and individual spectra obtained with VIMOS on the ESO-VLT. A total of 698 objects have a measured redshift, with 677 galaxies, two type-I AGN, and a small number of 19 contaminating stars. The targets of the spectroscopic survey are selected primarily on the basis of their photometric redshifts to ensure a broad population coverage. About 500 galaxies have z_(spec) \u003e 2, 48 of which have z_(spec) \u003e 4; the highest reliable redshifts reach beyond z_(spec) = 6. This data set approximately doubles the number of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts at z \u003e 3 in these fields. We discuss the general properties of the VUDS–DR1 sample in terms of the spectroscopic redshift distribution, the distribution of Lyman-α equivalent widths, and physical properties including stellar masses M_⋆ and star formation rates derived from spectral energy distribution fitting with the knowledge of z_(spec). We highlight the properties of the most massive star-forming galaxies, noting the wide range in spectral properties, with Lyman-α in emission or in absorption, and in imaging properties with compact, multi-component, or pair morphologies. We present the catalogue database and data products. All VUDS-DR1 data are publicly available and can be retrieved from a dedicated query-based database. Future VUDS data releases will follow this VUDS-DR1 to give access to the spectra and associated measurement of ~8000 objects in the full ~1 square degree of the VUDS survey.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253069","docid":253069,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265817","fileid":1265817,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253069,"filename":"aa27963-15.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"666d2bfd1531aa791f8c8f4bfce4d42f","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1579466,"mtime":"2017-06-02 16:56:17","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77913/1/aa27963-15.pdf"}],"eprintid":77913,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"aa27963-15.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253076","docid":253076,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265894","fileid":1265894,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253076,"filename":"1602.01842.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"2b9e5d19ae5c6cafd61d6dc21c830d43","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1060950,"mtime":"2017-06-02 17:56:34","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77913/2/1602.01842.pdf"}],"eprintid":77913,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1602.01842.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© ESO, 2017\n\nReceived: 15 December 2015\nAccepted: 26 May 2016\n\nThis work is supported by funding from the European Research Council Advanced Grant ERC–2010–AdG–268107–EARLY and by INAF Grants PRIN 2010, PRIN 2012 and PICS 2013.
