{"title":"Endpoint resolvent estimates for compact Riemannian manifolds","uri":"","abstract":"We prove L^p→L^p′ bounds for the resolvent of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension n   in the endpoint case p=2(n+1)/(n+3). It has the same behavior with respect to the spectral parameter z as its Euclidean analogue, due to Kenig–Ruiz–Sogge, provided a parabolic neighborhood of the positive half-line is removed. This is region is optimal, for instance, in the case of a sphere.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251402","docid":251402,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1250170","fileid":1250170,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251402,"filename":"1-s2.0-S0022123616303810-main.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"518c6e9b5eed1d12624108edd588ce93","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":379894,"mtime":"2017-04-27 21:07:37","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77013/1/1-s2.0-S0022123616303810-main.pdf"}],"eprintid":77013,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"1-s2.0-S0022123616303810-main.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251410","docid":251410,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1250278","fileid":1250278,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251410,"filename":"1611.00462","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"01b9b844e4edc1f10d2deff9fb42c2ed","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":219162,"mtime":"2017-04-27 21:44:06","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77013/2/1611.00462"}],"eprintid":77013,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1611.00462","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2016 Elsevier Inc. \n\nReceived 2 November 2016.
