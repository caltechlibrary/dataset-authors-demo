{"title":"On Sensor Coverage by Mobile Sensors","uri":"","abstract":"We study the problem of using a small number of mobile sensors to monitor various threats in a geographical area. Using some recent results on stochastic sensor scheduling, we propose a stochastic sensor movement strategy. We present simple conditions under which it is not possible to maintain a bounded estimate error covariance for all the threats. We also study a simple sub-optimal algorithm to generate stochastic trajectories. Simulations are presented to illustrate the results.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252336","docid":252336,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1258532","fileid":1258532,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252336,"filename":"04177412.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"497a2a5d9476ccadb4d861486198a52a","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":171728,"mtime":"2017-05-16 23:17:06","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77508/1/04177412.pdf"}],"eprintid":77508,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04177412.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE. \n\nResearch supported in part by the AFOSR grant F49620-01-1-0460 and in part by NSF grant CCR-0326554.","id":77508,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/75/08","datestamp":"2017-05-16 23:58:33","lastmod":"2017-05-16 23:58:33","status_changed":"2017-05-16 23:58:33","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Vijay","family":"Gupta","id":"Gupta-V","orcid":""},{"given":"David E.","family":"Jeffcoat","id":"Jeffcoat-D-E","orcid":""},{"given":"Richard M.","family":"Murray","id":"Murray-R-M","orcid":"0000-0002-5785-7481"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-12","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"5912-5917","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170516-161356985","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170516-161356985","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2006.377220","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4177412/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[1] V.
