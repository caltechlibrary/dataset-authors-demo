{"title":"In defense of Crazy Ideas","uri":"","abstract":"Like many of you, I get unsolicited manuscripts that make startling and revolutionary claims. In years past they arrived by snail mail and were often handwritten or typed with copious use of capital letters, exclamation marks, and hand-drawn diagrams.
