{"title":"The Teichmüller distance between finite index subgroups of PSL_2ℤ","uri":"","abstract":"For a given ϵ\u003e0, we show that there exist two finite index subgroups of PSL_2(ℤ) which are (1+ϵ)-quasisymmetrically conjugated and the conjugation homeomorphism is not conformal. This implies that for any ϵ\u003e0 there are two finite regular covers of the Modular once punctured torus T_0 (or just the Modular torus) and a (1+ϵ)-quasiconformal map between them that is not homotopic to a conformal map. As an application of the above results, we show that the orbit of the basepoint in the Teichmüller space T(S^p) of the punctured solenoid S^p under the action of the corresponding Modular group (which is the mapping class group of S^p [6], [7]) has the closure in T(S^p) strictly larger than the orbit and that the closure is necessarily uncountable.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251913","docid":251913,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255204","fileid":1255204,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251913,"filename":"art%3A10.1007%2Fs10711-008-9281-x.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"267d81420377d2b498401a91c5e88b50","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":460269,"mtime":"2017-05-08 21:56:38","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77266/1/art%253A10.1007%252Fs10711-008-9281-x.pdf"}],"eprintid":77266,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"art%3A10.1007%2Fs10711-008-9281-x.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252385","docid":252385,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1258897","fileid":1258897,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252385,"filename":"MS-1.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"cbe614fc5c6b85232639274d956533af","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":277792,"mtime":"2017-05-17 19:50:59","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77266/2/MS-1.pdf"}],"eprintid":77266,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"MS-1.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. \n\nReceived: 27 July 2007; Accepted: 3 July 2008; Published online: 1 August 2008.","id":77266,"rev_number":12,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/72/66","datestamp":"2017-05-15 19:53:07","lastmod":"2017-05-17 19:50:59","status_changed":"2017-05-15 19:53:07","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Vladimir","family":"Markovic","id":"Markovic-V","orcid":""},{"given":"Dragomir","family":"Šarić","id":"Šarić-D","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"Modular group; Teichmüller space; Quasiconformal maps; Dilatation; PSL2(Z);  Finite index subgroups; Solenoid; Ehrenpreis conjecture","date":"2008-10","date_type":"published","publication":"Geometriae Dedicata ","volume":"136","number":"1","pagerange":"145-165","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170508-145545361","refereed":true,"issn":"0046-5755 ","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170508-145545361","related_url":[{"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10711-008-9281-x","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10711-008-9281-x","type":"pub","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://rdcu.be/r1pE","type":"pub","description":"Free ReadCube access"}],"referencetext":["\n1.\n\nDouady A., Earle C.J.: Conformally natural extension of homeomorphisms of the circle.
