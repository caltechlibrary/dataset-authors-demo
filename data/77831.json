{"title":"All pure bipartite entangled states can be self-tested","uri":"","abstract":"Quantum technologies promise advantages over their classical counterparts in the fields of computation, security and sensing. It is thus desirable that classical users are able to obtain guarantees on quantum devices, even without any knowledge of their inner workings. That such classical certification is possible at all is remarkable: it is a consequence of the violation of Bell inequalities by entangled quantum systems. Device-independent self-testing refers to the most complete such certification: it enables a classical user to uniquely identify the quantum state shared by uncharacterized devices by simply inspecting the correlations of measurement outcomes. Self-testing was first demonstrated for the singlet state and a few other examples of self-testable states were reported in recent years. Here, we address the long-standing open question of whether every pure bipartite entangled state is self-testable. We answer it affirmatively by providing explicit self-testing correlations for all such states.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252889","docid":252889,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1264502","fileid":1264502,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252889,"filename":"ncomms15485.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"5e9d36dd0b2c7710671684bba32602f6","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":625511,"mtime":"2017-05-30 19:48:41","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77831/1/ncomms15485.pdf"}],"eprintid":77831,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"ncomms15485.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252890","docid":252890,"rev_number":4,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1264505","fileid":1264505,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252890,"filename":"ncomms15485-s1.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"49798e84de01fc107b17ff1e58888872","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":340949,"mtime":"2017-05-30 19:49:06","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77831/2/ncomms15485-s1.pdf"}],"eprintid":77831,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"ncomms15485-s1.pdf","content":"supplemental"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252891","docid":252891,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1264508","fileid":1264508,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252891,"filename":"1611.08062","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"5bc8110888852d0028e112270890a1c9","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1158432,"mtime":"2017-05-30 19:49:18","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77831/3/1611.08062"}],"eprintid":77831,"pos":3,"placement":3,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1611.08062","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2017 The Authors.
