{"title":"Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues on the Heisenberg group","uri":"","abstract":"We prove that for any domain in the Heisenberg group the (k+1)'th Neumann eigenvalue of the sub-Laplacian is strictly less than the k'th Dirichlet eigenvalue. As a byproduct we obtain similar inequalities for the Euclidean Laplacian with a homogeneous magnetic field.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252825","docid":252825,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263742","fileid":1263742,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252825,"filename":"0906.1402.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"4263c625e532af5f261a25d179c54fbe","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":172092,"mtime":"2017-05-26 16:20:44","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77801/1/0906.1402.pdf"}],"eprintid":77801,"pos":1,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0906.1402.pdf","content":"submitted"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252846","docid":252846,"rev_number":4,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263977","fileid":1263977,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252846,"filename":"rnp230.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"cedf10ad906f68beb9e4adcb8f5ca8d4","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":110412,"mtime":"2017-05-26 18:12:45","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77801/2/rnp230.pdf"}],"eprintid":77801,"pos":2,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"rnp230.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© The Author 2010.
