{"title":"Study Of Land Degradation With Polarimetric SAR And Visible/near-infrared Imaging Spectroscopy","uri":"","abstract":"The Manix Basin Area of the Mojave Desert has been used extensively  for the  cultivation of alfalfa with \ncenter-pivot sprinkler irrigation systems. Since 1972, \na series of these fields has been abandoned. Data were \ncollected using the Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar \nand Airborne Visible/Infrared  Imaging Spectrometer instruments   in   the   summer of 1990. Polarimetric \nanalysis of the AIRSAR data reveal changes  in  the morphology of the surfaces of the  abandoned  fields from  cultivation  patterns to patterns  resulting  from wind  erosion. Calculation of a  normalized difference vegetation  index (NDVI) based on the AVIRIS data suggests  that \nthe abandoned   fields support more vegetation than the \nundisturbed  areas for the first few years of abandonment, \nbut that the vegetation density on fields which have \nbeen abandoned for six or more years  is  lower  than   the  undisturbed   desert. Field observations confirm the remote sensing results.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253237","docid":253237,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1266989","fileid":1266989,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253237,"filename":"00700227.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"eb49caa900fe2a02f549ab414e4ecf50","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":402508,"mtime":"2017-06-06 00:44:18","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77955/1/00700227.pdf"}],"eprintid":77955,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00700227.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 1993 IEEE.","id":77955,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/79/55","datestamp":"2017-06-06 18:28:04","lastmod":"2017-06-06 18:28:04","status_changed":"2017-06-06 18:28:04","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Terrill W.","family":"Ray","id":"Ray-T-W","orcid":""},{"given":"Tom G.","family":"Farr","id":"Farr-T-G","orcid":""},{"given":"Jakob J.","family":"van Zyl","id":"van-Zyl-J-J","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"1993-03","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"228-231","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170605-173555159","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170605-173555159","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMEAS.1993.700227","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/700227/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[l] \nT. \nW. \nRay, \nT. \nG Farr \nand \nJ. \nJ. \nvan \nZyl, \n\"Detection \nof \nLand \nDegradation with \nPolarimetric \nSAR,\" \nGeophysical \nResearch \nLetters, \nVo1.19, \npp. \n1587-1590, \nAugust \n3,1992. \n[2] \nH. \nE. \nDregne, \nDesertifiuztion \nof \nArid \nLands, \nHarwood \nAcademic \nPublishers, \n1983. \n[3] \nG. \nT.
