{"title":"Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR observations of PSR J2032+4127/MT91 213","uri":"","abstract":"We report our recent Swift, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton X-ray and Lijiang optical\nobservations on PSR J2032+4127/MT91 213, the gamma-ray binary candidate with a\nperiod of 45-50 years. The coming periastron of the system was predicted to be\nin November 2017, around which high-energy flares from keV to TeV are expected.\nRecent studies with Chandra and Swift X-ray observations taken in 2015/16\nshowed that its X-ray emission has been brighter by a factors of ~10 than that\nbefore 2013, probably revealing some on-going activities between the pulsar\nwind and the stellar wind. Our new Swift/XRT lightcurve shows no strong\nevidence of a single vigorous brightening trend, but rather several strong\nX-ray flares on weekly to monthly timescales with a slowly brightening\nbaseline, namely the low state. The NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations taken\nduring the flaring and the low states, respectively, show a denser environment\nand a softer power-law index during the flaring state, implying that the pulsar\nwind interacted with stronger stellar winds of the companion to produce the\nflares. These precursors would be crucial in studying the predicted giant\noutburst from this extreme gamma-ray binary during the periastron passage in\nlate 2017.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252946","docid":252946,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1264893","fileid":1264893,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252946,"filename":"1705.09653.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"477f54bba2635471d49c2650e839760d","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":745374,"mtime":"2017-05-31 17:45:59","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77853/1/1705.09653.pdf"}],"eprintid":77853,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1705.09653.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"","id":77853,"rev_number":8,"userid":999,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/78/53","datestamp":"2017-05-31 18:03:56","lastmod":"2017-05-31 18:03:56","status_changed":"2017-05-31 18:03:56","type":"monograph","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"K.
