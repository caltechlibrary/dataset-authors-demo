{"title":"On the asymptotic number of edge states for magnetic Schrödinger operators","uri":"","abstract":"We consider a Schrödinger operator ( hD − A )^2 with a positive magnetic field B = curlA in a domain Ω ⊂ ℝ^2 . The imposing of Neumann boundary conditions leads to the existence of some spectrum below h ∈ f B . This is a boundary effect and it is related to the existence of edge states of the system. We show that the number of these eigenvalues, in the semi-classical limit h → 0, is governed by a Weyl-type law and that it involves a symbol on ∂Ω. In the particular case of a constant magnetic field, the curvature plays a major role.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252986","docid":252986,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265201","fileid":1265201,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252986,"filename":"pdl024.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"d17aa022e0e2cff2808dc41e6343a4a8","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":381713,"mtime":"2017-06-01 15:12:19","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77879/1/pdl024.pdf"}],"eprintid":77879,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"pdl024.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252987","docid":252987,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265204","fileid":1265204,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252987,"filename":"0603046.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"9fc548daa4a196f4533122fc46f1765b","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":267457,"mtime":"2017-06-01 15:12:41","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77879/2/0603046.pdf"}],"eprintid":77879,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0603046.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2007 London Mathematical Society. \n\nReceived 17 March 2006; revised 4 July 2006; published online 31 January 2007. \n\nThe author wishes to thank Professor B.
