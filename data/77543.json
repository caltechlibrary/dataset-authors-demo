{"title":"Indoor wireless channel modeling from 2.4 to 24 GHz using a combined E/H-Plane 2D ray tracing method","uri":"","abstract":"Future wireless systems are moving to high frequencies for additional bandwidth and frequency reuse. This makes it very important to have accurate and time-efficient models for system planning. We have previously published measurement results for an indoor channel investigation from 2.4 GHz to 24 GHz. We now propose a new combined E/H-plane 2D ray tracing method. This method includes 2D ray-tracing calculations from both horizontal and vertical sections (E/H-planes). The method predicts loss accurately for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths at five frequency bands from 2.4 GHz to 24 GHz. In addition, it predicts the delay spread for line-of-sight paths well, but fails for non-line-of-sight paths.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252408","docid":252408,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1259316","fileid":1259316,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252408,"filename":"01330135.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"28185ffe0495cfc282dabeac4748c7fa","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":168516,"mtime":"2017-05-18 00:48:40","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77543/1/01330135.pdf"}],"eprintid":77543,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01330135.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2004 IEEE. \n\nWe would like to thank the Lee Center for Advanced Networking far the support of this research work.","id":77543,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/75/43","datestamp":"2017-05-18 19:05:30","lastmod":"2017-05-18 19:05:30","status_changed":"2017-05-18 19:05:30","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Dai","family":"Lu","id":"Lu-Dai","orcid":""},{"given":"David","family":"Rutledge","id":"Rutledge-D-B","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2004-06","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"4","number":"","pagerange":"3641-3644","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170517-174608017","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170517-174608017","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2004.1330135","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1330135/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"Dai Lu and D.
