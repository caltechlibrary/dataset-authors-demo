{"title":"Distributed Averaging on Asynchronous Communication Networks","uri":"","abstract":"Distributed algorithms for averaging have attracted interest in the control and sensing literature. However, previous works have not addressed some practical concerns that will arise in actual implementations on packet-switched communication networks such as the Internet. In this paper, we present several implementable algorithms that are robust to asynchronism and dynamic topology changes. The algorithms do not require global coordination and can be proven to converge under very general asynchronous timing assumptions. Our results are verified by both simulation and experiments on a real-world TCP/IP network.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252403","docid":252403,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1259280","fileid":1259280,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252403,"filename":"01583363.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"d49c06625bbde248b52cb155c6f5636a","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":160778,"mtime":"2017-05-17 23:48:35","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77538/1/01583363.pdf"}],"eprintid":77538,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01583363.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2005 IEEE.","id":77538,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/75/38","datestamp":"2017-05-18 15:54:54","lastmod":"2017-05-18 15:54:54","status_changed":"2017-05-18 15:54:54","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Mortada","family":"Mehyar","id":"Mehyar-M","orcid":""},{"given":"Demetri","family":"Spanos","id":"Spanos-D-P","orcid":""},{"given":"John","family":"Pongsajapan","id":"Pongsajapan-J","orcid":""},{"given":"Steven H.","family":"Low","id":"Low-S-H","orcid":""},{"given":"Richard M.","family":"Murray","id":"Murray-R-M","orcid":"0000-0002-5785-7481"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2005-12","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"7446-7451","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170517-164222886","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170517-164222886","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2005.1583363","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1583363/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["1] D.P.
