{"title":"Low complexity algebraic multicast network codes","uri":"","abstract":"We present a low complexity  algorithm for designing  algebraic  codes that achieve the info mation  theoretic  capacity for the multicast  problem on directed  acyclic  networks. These  codes  operate over  field sizes which  are  significantly  smaller than those previously known, leading to significantly lower design  and  implementation  complexity,  and network link usage. These codes can be extended for networks with cycles and delays, and for robustness properties.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252568","docid":252568,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261487","fileid":1261487,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252568,"filename":"01228384.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"cc87d3d6c2444fb5430ae7cc8d7c998d","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":143909,"mtime":"2017-05-22 22:56:04","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77635/1/01228384.pdf"}],"eprintid":77635,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01228384.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2003 IEEE. \n\nThe first author was supported by Microsoft Corporation.","id":77635,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/76/35","datestamp":"2017-05-22 23:08:34","lastmod":"2017-05-22 23:08:34","status_changed":"2017-05-22 23:08:34","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Sidharth","family":"Jaggi","id":"Jaggi-Sidharth","orcid":""},{"given":"Philip A.","family":"Chou","id":"Chou-Philip-A","orcid":""},{"given":"Kamal","family":"Jain","id":"Jain-Kamal","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2003-06","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"368-368","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170522-154344636","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170522-154344636","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2003.1228384","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1228384/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[l] \nR. \nAhlswede, \nN. \nCai, \nS.-Y. \nR. \nLi, \nand \nR. \nW. \nYeung, \n“Network \nInformation Flow”, \nIEEE \nThnsactions \non Information \nTheory, \n[2] \nR. \nKoetter, \nM. \nMedard, \n“An \nAlgebraic \nApproach \nto \nNetwork \nCoding”, \npresented \nat \nINFOCOM \n2002. \n[3] \nP. \nSanders, \nS. \nEgner, \nL. \nTolhuizen,  “Polynomial \nTime \nAlgo- \nrithms \nfor \nNetwork \nInformation \nFlow”, \nProc. \nof \nthe 15th \nACM \nSymposium \non \nParallelism in  Algorithms \nand \nArchitectures. \n[4] \nP. \nA. \nChou, \nM. \nEffros, \nS. \nEgner, \nS. \nJaggi, \nK. \nJain, \nP. \nSanders, \nL. \nTolhuizen,  “Linear Multicast \nNetwork \nCoding \nAlgorithms”, \nin \npreparation \nfor \nIEEE \nTransactions \non \nInformation \nTheory.
