{"title":"Attachment of Cobalt “Picket Fence” Porphyrin to the Surface of Gold Electrodes Coated with 1-(10-Mercaptodecyl)imidazole","uri":"","abstract":"Self-assembled monolayers of 1-(10-mercaptodecyl)imidazole on Au electrodes were used to bind cobalt “picket fence” porphyrin (cobalt 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(α,α,α,α-2-pivalamidophenyl)porphyrin) to the electrode surface. The binding involved coordination of the cobalt center of the porphyrin to the pendant imidazole groups in the monolayer coating. Attempts to coordinate the Co(II) oxidation state of the porphyrin to the coatings were not successful. However, with the Co(III) oxidation state, substantial binding was achieved which persisted even when the Co(III) was reduced to Co(II). Absorption spectra of the attached porphyrin were obtained for both oxidation states of the cobalt center. The remaining axial coordination site on the attached cobalt porphyrin is accessible to ligands, for example, imidazole, in aqueous solution.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251384","docid":251384,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1249819","fileid":1249819,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251384,"filename":"la011444r.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"19f1cb084ba7fd065481f1a05c449086","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":70432,"mtime":"2017-04-27 17:36:00","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/76998/1/la011444r.pdf"}],"eprintid":76998,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"la011444r.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251385","docid":251385,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1249824","fileid":1249824,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251385,"filename":"la011444r_s.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"6adcab487b64d14bf54265214dbb0f63","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":45117,"mtime":"2017-04-27 17:38:40","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/76998/2/la011444r_s.pdf"}],"eprintid":76998,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"la011444r_s.pdf","content":"supplemental"}],"note":"© 2002 American Chemical Society. \n\nReceived 17 September 2001.
