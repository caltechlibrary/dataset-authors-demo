{"title":"Polymer-Based nanoparticle therapeutics","uri":"","abstract":"We have translated three polymer-based nanoparticles into the clinic for use as cancer therapeutics. One of these nanoparticle, exptl. therapeutics was the first to show functional RNA interference (RNAi) in humans. At this time, these nanoparticles have been investigated in over 10 different clin. trials. I will describe how we\ntranslated these nanoparticles from the lab. at Caltech into clin., exptl. therapeutics. In addn. to investigations of polymer-based nanoparticle therapeutics for cancer, we are now concg. on developing polymer-based nanoparticles that cross the blood-brain-barrier. Our recent efforts will be presented.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251601","docid":251601,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252039","fileid":1252039,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251601,"filename":"Davis_2017pPOLY-65.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"54464c83bcbea5fa81d078c3a1012bfe","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":88634,"mtime":"2017-05-02 17:26:22","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77123/1/Davis_2017pPOLY-65.pdf"}],"eprintid":77123,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Davis_2017pPOLY-65.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77123,"rev_number":9,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/23","datestamp":"2017-05-02 17:49:31","lastmod":"2017-05-02 17:49:31","status_changed":"2017-05-02 17:49:31","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Mark E.","family":"Davis","id":"Davis-M-E","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"POLY-65","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170502-102605956","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170502-102605956","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
