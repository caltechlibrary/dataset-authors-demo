{"title":"Rank minimization and applications in system theory","uri":"","abstract":"In this tutorial paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the rank of a matrix over a convex set. The rank minimization problem (RMP) arises in diverse areas such as control, system identification, statistics and signal processing, and is known to be computationally NP-hard. We give an overview of the problem, its interpretations, applications, and solution methods. In particular, we focus on how convex optimization can be used to develop heuristic methods for this problem.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252459","docid":252459,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1259680","fileid":1259680,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252459,"filename":"01384521.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"1944a30725724045b245a649b6dec6cb","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":455333,"mtime":"2017-05-18 18:23:20","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77572/1/01384521.pdf"}],"eprintid":77572,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01384521.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2004 IEEE.","id":77572,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/75/72","datestamp":"2017-05-18 18:43:43","lastmod":"2017-05-18 18:43:43","status_changed":"2017-05-18 18:43:43","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"M.","family":"Fazel","id":"Fazel-M","orcid":""},{"given":"H.","family":"Hindi","id":"Hindi-H","orcid":""},{"given":"S.","family":"Boyd","id":"Boyd-S","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2004-06","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"4","number":"","pagerange":"3273-3278","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170518-112026555","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170518-112026555","related_url":[{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1384521/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"M.
