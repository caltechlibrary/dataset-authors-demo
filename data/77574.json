{"title":"Remarks on certain new methods for blind identification of FIR channels","uri":"","abstract":"This paper discusses a number of issues pertaining to blind identification of channels. The basics of blind identification are first discussed and a method called Vandermonde method is presented which is based on elementary linear system principles. Then some remarks are made about precoders with paraunitary antipodal preprocessors. It is argued that such preprocessors usually destroy signal richness which is a necessary feature in blind identification systems.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252464","docid":252464,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1259731","fileid":1259731,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252464,"filename":"01399254.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"9a74714aa0504959791f956e89ca531b","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":600339,"mtime":"2017-05-18 18:48:09","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77574/1/01399254.pdf"}],"eprintid":77574,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01399254.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2004 IEEE. \n\nWork supported in part by the NSF grant CCF-0428326 and\nCaltech’s Moore Fellowship.","id":77574,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/75/74","datestamp":"2017-05-18 18:54:59","lastmod":"2017-05-18 18:54:59","status_changed":"2017-05-18 18:54:59","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"P.
