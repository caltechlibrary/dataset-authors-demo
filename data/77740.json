{"title":"Analytical study of free-space coupling of THz radiation for a new radioastronomy receiver concept","uri":"","abstract":"In this paper, a scheme for coupling free-space THz radiation into a nonlinear whispering-gallery mode (WGM) resonator is presented. The purpose is to detect the weak THz radiation from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by up-converting the signal into the optical domain via the nonlinearity of the medium. Such high-sensitivity receiver has theoretically shown capabilities towards photon counting at room temperature, however, it is critical to efficiently couple the THz radiation into the resonator. Therefore, by using the Schelkunoff-Waterman method (the so called T-matrix method) we perform an analytical evaluation of two different free-space coupling techniques: a freespace Gaussian beam, and a Gaussian beam incident in a silicon lens under total internal reflection. By comparing the excited modes in the resonator, the optimal parameters for each case are given.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252738","docid":252738,"rev_number":4,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1262914","fileid":1262914,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252738,"filename":"07928481.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"d60a98b0ab235d20fb524aa38cc12ec1","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":840504,"mtime":"2017-05-24 23:43:58","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77740/1/07928481.pdf"}],"eprintid":77740,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"07928481.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2017 IEEE. \n\nThis work has been financially supported by “DiDaCTIC: Desarrollo de un sistema de comunicaciones inalambrico en  rango THz integrado de alta tasa de datos”, TEC2013-47753-C3, CAM S2013/ICE-3004 “DIFRAGEOS” projects, “Proyecto realizado con la Ayuda Fundacíon BBVA a Investigadores y Creadores Culturales 2016.” and “Estancias de movilidad de profesores PRX16/00021”.","id":77740,"rev_number":10,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/77/40","datestamp":"2017-05-25 16:29:20","lastmod":"2017-05-25 16:29:20","status_changed":"2017-05-25 16:29:20","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Gabriel Santamaría","family":"Botello","id":"Botello-G-S","orcid":""},{"given":"Kerlos Atia","family":"Abdalmalak","id":"Abdalmalak-K-A","orcid":""},{"given":"Maria-Theresa","family":"Schlecht","id":"Schlecht-M-T","orcid":""},{"given":"David","family":"González-Ovejero","id":"González-Ovejero-D","orcid":""},{"given":"Florian","family":"Sedlmeir","id":"Sedlmeir-F","orcid":""},{"given":"Harald G.
