{"title":"Opportunities for Price Manipulation by Aggregators in Electricity Markets","uri":"","abstract":"Aggregators of distributed generation are playing an increasingly crucial role in the integration of renewable energy in power systems. However, the intermittent nature of renewable generation makes market interactions of aggregators difficult to monitor and regulate, raising concerns about potential market manipulation by aggregators. In this paper, we study this issue by quantifying the profit an aggregator can obtain through strategic curtailment of generation in an electricity market. We show that, while the problem of maximizing the benefit from curtailment is hard in general, efficient algorithms exist when the topology of the network is radial (acyclic). Further, we highlight that significant increases in profit are possible via strategic curtailment in practical settings.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252740","docid":252740,"rev_number":4,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1262930","fileid":1262930,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252740,"filename":"07898782.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"052092c13f446ccba2f3abc1a3a9e8a7","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1294453,"mtime":"2017-05-25 00:17:03","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77742/1/07898782.pdf"}],"eprintid":77742,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"07898782.pdf","content":"inpress"}],"note":"© 2017 IEEE. \n\nThe first two authors contributed equally. \n\nThis work was supported in part by NSF grant 1545096 as part of the NSF/DHS/DOT/NASA/NIH  Cyber-Physical Systems Program, NSF grant NeTS-1518941, NSF grant AitF-1637598, and NSF grant EPAS-1307794.","id":77742,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/77/42","datestamp":"2017-05-25 16:24:08","lastmod":"2017-05-25 16:24:08","status_changed":"2017-05-25 16:24:08","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Navid Azizan","family":"Ruhi","id":"Ruhi-N-A","orcid":"0000-0002-4299-2963"},{"given":"Krishnamurthy","family":"Dvijotham","id":"Dvijotham-K","orcid":"000-0002-1328-4677"},{"given":"Niangjun","family":"Chen","id":"Chen-Niangjun","orcid":""},{"given":"Adam","family":"Wierman","id":"Wierman-A","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"inpress","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"Aggregators,  renewables,  optimal  curtailment,\nmarket power, locational marginal price (LMP)","date":"2017-05-23","date_type":"inpress","publication":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170524-171255595","refereed":true,"issn":"1949-3053","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170524-171255595","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2694043","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7898782/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[1]   K.
