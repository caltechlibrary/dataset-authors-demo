{"title":"Modal mineralogy of planetary surfaces from visible and near-infrared spectral data","uri":"","abstract":"Real planetary surfaces are composed of several to many different minerals and ices. Deconvolving a reflectance spectrum to material abundance in an unambiguous way is difficult, because the spectra are complex nonlinear functions of grain size, abundance, and material opacity. Multiple scattering models can provide approximate solutions to the radiative transfer in a particulate medium. The paper examines the different approaches which deal with the theory of radiative transfer on atmosphereless bodies. We present the relative merits of two scattering theories based on the equivalent slab model: the extensively used Hapke theory [1] and the Shkuratov theory [2]. The performances of the two models for determining mineral abundance in multicomponent mixtures are also evaluated using laboratory data. Finally, one application on real planetary surfaces will be shown.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253092","docid":253092,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1266047","fileid":1266047,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253092,"filename":"05594898.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"90729cb5519445485ae7fbb6ead0f7e8","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":169227,"mtime":"2017-06-02 20:14:45","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77923/1/05594898.pdf"}],"eprintid":77923,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"05594898.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2010 IEEE. \n\nDate Added to IEEE Xplore: 04 October 2010.","id":77923,"rev_number":8,"userid":772,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/79/23","datestamp":"2017-06-02 21:04:33","lastmod":"2017-06-02 21:04:33","status_changed":"2017-06-02 21:04:33","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"F.","family":"Poulet","id":"Poulet-F","orcid":""},{"given":"B.
