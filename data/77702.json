{"title":"CO excitation in the Seyfert galaxy NGC7130","uri":"","abstract":"We present a coherent multi-band modelling of the CO Spectral Energy\nDistribution of the local Seyfert Galaxy NGC7130 to assess the impact of the\nAGN activity on the molecular gas. We take advantage of all the available data\nfrom X-ray to the sub-mm, including ALMA data. The high-resolution (~0.2\") ALMA\nCO(6-5) data constrain the spatial extension of the CO emission down to ~70 pc\nscale. From the analysis of the archival CHANDRA and NuSTAR data, we infer the\npresence of a buried, Compton-thick AGN of moderate luminosity, L_2-10keV ~\n1.6x10^{43} ergs-1. We explore photodissociation and X-ray-dominated regions\n(PDRs and XDRs) models to reproduce the CO emission. We find that PDRs can\nreproduce the CO lines up to J~6, however, the higher rotational ladder\nrequires the presence of a separate source of excitation. We consider X-ray\nheating by the AGN as a source of excitation, and find that it can reproduce\nthe observed CO Spectral Energy Distribution. By adopting a composite PDR+XDR\nmodel, we derive molecular cloud properties. Our study clearly indicates the\ncapabilities offered by current-generation of instruments to shed light on the\nproperties of nearby galaxies adopting state-of-the art physical modelling.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252676","docid":252676,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1262382","fileid":1262382,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252676,"filename":"1705.08221.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"ab74775ff32068fbe568ca1cf3c25168","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":548243,"mtime":"2017-05-24 16:43:35","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77702/1/1705.08221.pdf"}],"eprintid":77702,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1705.08221.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"We acknowledge support from Italian node of the Alma Regional\nCenter.
