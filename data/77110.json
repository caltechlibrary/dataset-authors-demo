{"title":"Optofluidics","uri":"","abstract":"Optofluidics refers to a class of adaptive circuits that integrate optical and fluidic devices. Familiar examples include liquid crystals and dye lasers. The introduction of liquids in the optical structure enables flexible fine-tuning and reconfiguration of circuits so they can perform tasks optimally in a changing environment. The emergence of fluidic transport technologies at the micron and nanometer levels which opens possibilities for novel devices is discussed.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251576","docid":251576,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1251780","fileid":1251780,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251576,"filename":"01708321.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"86aa0074963537eb118f97a7d378871a","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":159206,"mtime":"2017-05-01 22:35:21","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77110/1/01708321.pdf"}],"eprintid":77110,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01708321.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2006 IEEE.","id":77110,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/10","datestamp":"2017-05-01 22:40:35","lastmod":"2017-05-01 22:40:35","status_changed":"2017-05-01 22:40:35","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Demetri","family":"Psaltis","id":"Psaltis-D","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-08","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"174","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170501-153041475","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170501-153041475","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OMEMS.2006.1708321","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1708321/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[1] Psaltis, D, S.
