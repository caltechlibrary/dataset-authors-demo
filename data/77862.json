{"title":"Deriving analytic solutions for compact binary inspirals without recourse to adiabatic approximations","uri":"","abstract":"We utilize the dynamical renormalization group formalism to calculate the real space trajectory of a compact binary inspiral for long times via a systematic resummation of secularly growing terms. This method generates closed form solutions without orbit averaging, and the accuracy can be systematically improved. The expansion parameter is v^5νΩ(t−t_0) where t_0 is the initial time, t is the time elapsed, and Ω and v are the angular orbital frequency and initial speed, respectively. ν is the binary’s symmetric mass ratio. We demonstrate how to apply the renormalization group method to resum solutions beyond leading order in two ways. First, we calculate the second-order corrections of the leading radiation reaction force, which involves highly nontrivial checks of the formalism (i.e., its renormalizability). Second, we show how to systematically include post-Newtonian corrections to the radiation reaction force. By avoiding orbit averaging, we gain predictive power and eliminate ambiguities in the initial conditions. Finally, we discuss how this methodology can be used to find analytic solutions to the spin equations of motion that are valid over long times.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252959","docid":252959,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265018","fileid":1265018,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252959,"filename":"PhysRevD.95.104054.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"73538abbb233dc27d0cff3c6115310ec","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":370332,"mtime":"2017-05-31 20:29:32","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77862/1/PhysRevD.95.104054.pdf"}],"eprintid":77862,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"PhysRevD.95.104054.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252960","docid":252960,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265020","fileid":1265020,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252960,"filename":"1609.08268.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"0dbbff383f3512a23e0cd8ee16a823b5","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":526501,"mtime":"2017-05-31 20:29:39","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77862/2/1609.08268.pdf"}],"eprintid":77862,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1609.08268.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2017 American Physical Society. \n\nReceived 28 October 2016; published 31 May 2017. \n\nWe thank Luc Blanchet, Marc Favata, Bala Iyer, and Nico Yunes for useful discussions and comments on a previous draft.
