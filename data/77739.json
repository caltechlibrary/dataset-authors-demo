{"title":"Computational modeling in design of endovascular Chemofilter device for removing toxins from blood","uri":"","abstract":"Intra-arterial chemotherapy delivery (IAC) for treating cancer can lead to significant cardiac toxicity due to the drainage of excess drug to the systemic circulation. A catheter-based Chemofilter device temporarily inserted into the veins downstream of the tumor can remove chemotherapy drugs out of the blood stream right after these drugs have had their effect on the tumor. In this research, computational modeling is used to design the Chemofilter and optimize its hemodynamics performance.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252737","docid":252737,"rev_number":4,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1262906","fileid":1262906,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252737,"filename":"07928894.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"367e42f4b0af2c01928d0064112aa7c2","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":174222,"mtime":"2017-05-24 23:32:26","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77739/1/07928894.pdf"}],"eprintid":77739,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"07928894.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 IEEE.","id":77739,"rev_number":10,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/77/39","datestamp":"2017-05-25 16:26:34","lastmod":"2017-05-25 16:26:34","status_changed":"2017-05-25 16:26:34","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Nazanin","family":"Maani","id":"Maani-N","orcid":""},{"given":"Daryl","family":"Yee","id":"Yee-Daryl-W","orcid":""},{"given":"Julia R.","family":"Greer","id":"Greer-J-R","orcid":"0000-0002-9675-1508"},{"given":"Micheal","family":"Nosonovsky","id":"Nosonovsky-M","orcid":""},{"given":"Steven W.","family":"Hetts","id":"Hetts-S-W","orcid":""},{"given":"Vitaliy L.","family":"Rayz","id":"Rayz-V-L","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"chemofilter; microcells; multiscale approach","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170524-162636343","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170524-162636343","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLBC.2017.7928894","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7928894/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"N.
