{"title":"A macroscopic model of an aggregation experiment using embodied agents in groups of time-varying sizes","uri":"","abstract":"In this paper, we present a mathematical model of an aggregation experiment carried out using multiple embodied  agents in teams of time-varying sizes. The aggregation  experiment is concerned with the gathering and the clustering of small objects initially scattered  in an enclosed arena. The number of active agents engaged in the aggregation  task is  varying  according to a  local, distributed stimulus-response law, similar to   the behavior   observed in ant colonies. We use a  set of differential equations to describe the dynamics of the system at the macroscopic level. We validate the predictions of this model by comparing   them to experimental data obtained  using a sensor-based embodied simulator. Results  show that the proposed approach delivers accurate predictions and constitutes a computationally efficient tool \nfor studying  aggregation experiments  with  groups of \nconstant or variable  sizes. The simplicity of the model suggests that it  is  easily applicable to other aggregation or segregation experiments characterized \nby different agent capabilities and individual control algorithms.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252578","docid":252578,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261611","fileid":1261611,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252578,"filename":"01173419.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"72768549b08189d03a214de151b5662f","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":652995,"mtime":"2017-05-23 00:30:57","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77644/1/01173419.pdf"}],"eprintid":77644,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01173419.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2002 IEEE. \n\nWe would like to thank Dr. Ian  Kelly for his remarks. \nThis   work is supported in part by the TRW Foundation \nand the Caltech Center for Neuromorphic Systems Engineering as part of the NSF Engineering Research Center Program under grant EEC-9402726.
