{"title":"Dry coupling for whole-body small-animal photoacoustic computed tomography","uri":"","abstract":"We have enhanced photoacoustic computed tomography with dry acoustic coupling that eliminates water immersion anxiety and wrinkling of the animal and facilitates incorporating complementary modalities and procedures. The dry acoustic coupler is made of a tubular elastic membrane enclosed by a closed transparent water tank. The tubular membrane ensures water-free contact with the animal, and the closed water tank allows pressurization for animal stabilization. The dry coupler was tested using a whole-body small-animal ring-shaped photoacoustic computed tomography system. Dry coupling was found to provide image quality comparable to that of conventional water coupling.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253036","docid":253036,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265658","fileid":1265658,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253036,"filename":"JBO_22_4_041017.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"c49959f6c8a8619aa799f639d0278e78","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":3409630,"mtime":"2017-06-02 14:16:36","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77905/1/JBO_22_4_041017.pdf"}],"eprintid":77905,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"JBO_22_4_041017.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253044","docid":253044,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265691","fileid":1265691,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253044,"filename":"jbo_22_4_041017_ds001.mov","mime_type":"video/mp4","hash":"be119707027a941f47077505fe7e2f11","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":5613668,"mtime":"2017-06-02 14:55:24","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77905/2/jbo_22_4_041017_ds001.mov"}],"eprintid":77905,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"video/mp4","format":"video/mpeg","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"jbo_22_4_041017_ds001.mov","content":"supplemental"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253045","docid":253045,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265693","fileid":1265693,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253045,"filename":"jbo_22_4_041017_ds002.mov","mime_type":"video/mp4","hash":"eaa8816d3cb66ae7acf21a82d184b232","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":2086995,"mtime":"2017-06-02 14:55:31","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77905/3/jbo_22_4_041017_ds002.mov"}],"eprintid":77905,"pos":3,"placement":3,"mime_type":"video/mp4","format":"video/mpeg","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"jbo_22_4_041017_ds002.mov","content":"supplemental"}],"note":"© 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). \n\nPaper 160544SSR received Aug. 10, 2016; accepted for publication Feb. 8, 2017; published online Feb. 23, 2017. \n\nThe authors appreciate the close reading of the manuscript by Prof. James Ballard.
