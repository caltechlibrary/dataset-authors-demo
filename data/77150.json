{"title":"Pulsed-laser synthesis of advanced nanomaterials for water-oxidation catalysis and sunlight capture","uri":"","abstract":"Conversion of solar energy into storable fuels is essential to meet future global energy demands. Efficient, robust catalysts and light absorbers that are exclusively made of non-precious elements are imperative for a sustainable energy economy. In pulsed-laser synthesis, nanoparticles are formed by very rapid cooling of a laser-induced plasma comprised of elements from the solid target and the surrounding liq. We achieved control of nanoparticle size, polydispersity, and compn. by choice of laser pulse energy and the chem. nature of the solid target or liq. medium. We have readily prepd. multi-metal nanomaterials with tailored compns. by adding metal ions into the aq. liq.; our approach allowed us to rapidly optimize highly active, robust [NiFe]-layered double hydroxide nanocatalysts for water oxidn. in base. Choice of dissolved anions mattered for zinc or copper-based nanomineral formation. We also applied our method to make mixed-metal tungsten oxide\nnanomaterials for oxidative photocatalysis in aq. acid.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251652","docid":251652,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252843","fileid":1252843,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251652,"filename":"Mueller_2017pINOR-71.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"77fa2a01505d5ba9dd5215b3bf56f40a","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":89810,"mtime":"2017-05-03 17:36:56","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77150/1/Mueller_2017pINOR-71.pdf"}],"eprintid":77150,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Mueller_2017pINOR-71.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77150,"rev_number":8,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/50","datestamp":"2017-05-03 18:10:32","lastmod":"2017-05-03 18:10:32","status_changed":"2017-05-03 18:10:32","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Astrid M.","family":"Mueller","id":"Müller-A-M","orcid":""},{"given":"Jay R.","family":"Winkler","id":"Winkler-J-R","orcid":""},{"given":"Harry B.","family":"Gray","id":"Gray-H-B","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"INOR-71","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-103650482","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-103650482","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
