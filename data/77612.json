{"title":"Analysis of NuSTAR and Suzaku observations of Cyg X-1 in the hard state: evidence for a truncated disc geometry","uri":"","abstract":"The geometry of the accretion flow in black-hole X-ray binaries in the hard\nstate, in particular the position of the disc inner edge, has been a subject of\nintense debate in recent years. We address this issue by performing a spectral\nstudy of simultaneous observations of Cyg X-1 in the hard state by\n{\\it{NuSTAR}\\} and {\\it{Suzaku}}. The same data were analysed before, and\nmodelled by a lamppost containing hybrid electrons and located very close to\nthe horizon, which emission was incident on a surrounding disc extending almost\nto the innermost stable circular orbit. We re-analyse the incident continuum\nmodel and show that it suffers from the lack of physical self-consistency.\nStill, the good fit to the data provided by this model indicates that the real\ncontinuum has a similar shape. We find it features a strong soft X-ray excess\nbelow a few keV, which we model as a soft thermal-Comptonization component, in\naddition to the main hard thermal-Compton component. This continuum model with\nreflection of both components yields the overall lowest $\\chi^2$ and has a\ngeometry with a hot inner accretion flow and a disc truncated at $\\simeq$13--20\ngravitational radii. On the other hand, we have also found a spectral solution\nwith a lamppost at a large height and a disc that can extend to the innnermost\nstable circular orbit. Overall, we find the fitted truncation radius depends on\nthe assumed continuum and geometry.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252523","docid":252523,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1260868","fileid":1260868,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252523,"filename":"1705.06638.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"62c676ecb6046890146339fe7bb2c935","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1455808,"mtime":"2017-05-20 23:19:25","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77612/1/1705.06638.pdf"}],"eprintid":77612,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1705.06638.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"We thank John Tomsick for providing us with the wind-absorption\nmodel used in this work, and Thomas Dauser, Chris Done, Javier\nGarc´ıa, Andrzej Niedzwiecki, and Jorn Wilms for valuable discussions.
