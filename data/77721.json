{"title":"A note on matter superenergy tensors","uri":"","abstract":"We consider Bel–Robinson-like higher derivative conserved two-index tensors H_(μν) in simple matter models, following a recently suggested Maxwell field version. In flat space, we show that they are essentially equivalent to the true stress tensors. In curved Ricci-flat backgrounds it is possible to redefine H_(μν) so as to overcome non-commutativity of covariant derivatives, and maintain conservation, but they become model and dimension dependent, and generally lose their simple 'BR' form.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252712","docid":252712,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1262666","fileid":1262666,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252712,"filename":"S_Deser_2003_Class._Quantum_Grav._20_102.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"2e80a09222f6037262a4d25a63117579","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":68795,"mtime":"2017-05-24 20:56:51","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77721/1/S_Deser_2003_Class._Quantum_Grav._20_102.pdf"}],"eprintid":77721,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"S_Deser_2003_Class._Quantum_Grav._20_102.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252713","docid":252713,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1262669","fileid":1262669,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252713,"filename":"0304095.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"417cce9a0ac54200b993d53e521099a0","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":60546,"mtime":"2017-05-24 20:57:02","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77721/2/0304095.pdf"}],"eprintid":77721,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0304095.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2003 IOP Publishing Ltd. \n\nReceived 11 June 2003; Published 17 July 2003. \n\nI acknowledge correspondence with the authors of [3].
