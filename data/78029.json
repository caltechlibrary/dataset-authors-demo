{"title":"Manipulating the ABCs of self-assembly via low-χ block polymer design","uri":"","abstract":"Block polymer self-assembly typically translates molecular chain connectivity into mesoscale structure by exploiting incompatible blocks with large interaction parameters (χ_ij). In this article, we demonstrate that the converse approach, encoding low-χ interactions in ABC bottlebrush triblock terpolymers (χ_(AC) ≲ 0), promotes organization into a unique mixed-domain lamellar morphology, which we designate LAM_P. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that LAM_P exhibits ACBC domain connectivity, in contrast to conventional three-domain lamellae (LAM_3) with ABCB periods. Complementary small-angle X-ray scattering experiments reveal a strongly decreasing domain spacing with increasing total molar mass. Self-consistent field theory reinforces these observations and predicts that LAM_P is thermodynamically stable below a critical χ_(AC), above which LAM_3 emerges. Both experiments and theory expose close analogies to ABA′ triblock copolymer phase behavior, collectively suggesting that low-χ interactions between chemically similar or distinct blocks intimately influence self-assembly. These conclusions provide fresh opportunities for block polymer design with potential consequences spanning all self-assembling soft materials.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253382","docid":253382,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1268111","fileid":1268111,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253382,"filename":"PNAS-2017-Chang-1701386114.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"e74b3183602e2c3c57e11c7098bb6310","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1019226,"mtime":"2017-06-08 18:11:02","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/78029/1/PNAS-2017-Chang-1701386114.pdf"}],"eprintid":78029,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"PNAS-2017-Chang-1701386114.pdf","content":"inpress"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253383","docid":253383,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1268116","fileid":1268116,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253383,"filename":"pnas.1701386114.sapp.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"ffe56e8be469a71d2405623199597658","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":3747778,"mtime":"2017-06-08 18:12:25","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/78029/2/pnas.1701386114.sapp.pdf"}],"eprintid":78029,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"pnas.1701386114.sapp.pdf","content":"supplemental"}],"note":"© 2017 National Academy of Sciences. \n\nContributed by Robert H.
