{"title":"Topological entropy and diffeomorphisms of surfaces with wandering domains","uri":"","abstract":"Let M be a closed surface and f a diffeomorphism of M. A diffeomorphism is said to permute a dense collection of domains, if the union of the domains are dense and the iterates of any one domain are mutually disjoint. In this note, we show that if f ∈ Diff^(1+ α)(M), with α \u003e 0,\nand permutes a dense collection of domains with bounded geometry, then f has zero topological entropy.\n","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251902","docid":251902,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255130","fileid":1255130,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251902,"filename":"vol35pp503-513.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"80a29141d5787eb3dce6c8522033e623","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":516912,"mtime":"2017-05-08 20:57:04","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77263/1/vol35pp503-513.pdf"}],"eprintid":77263,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"vol35pp503-513.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251903","docid":251903,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255132","fileid":1255132,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251903,"filename":"0910.1316.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"c313b2c7b744851028f86ac8c0c506cd","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":167947,"mtime":"2017-05-08 20:57:11","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77263/2/0910.1316.pdf"}],"eprintid":77263,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0910.1316.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2003 Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia.\n\nReceived 14 September 2009.\n\nThe first author was supported by Marie Curie grant MRTN-CT-2006-035651 (CODY).\n\n","id":77263,"rev_number":9,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/72/63","datestamp":"2017-05-09 23:01:53","lastmod":"2017-05-09 23:01:53","status_changed":"2017-05-09 23:01:53","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Ferry","family":"Kwakkel","id":"Kwakkel-F","orcid":""},{"given":"Vladimir","family":"Markovic","id":"Markovic-V","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"Quasiconformal mappings, entropy, wandering domains.","date":"2010","date_type":"published","publication":"Annales Academiae Scientiarum Fennicae.
