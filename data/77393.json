{"title":"Remarks about Hardy inequalities on metric trees","uri":"","abstract":"We find sharp conditions on the growth of a rooted regular metric tree such that the Neumann Laplacian on the tree satisfies a Hardy inequality. In particular, we consider homogeneous metric trees. Moreover, we show that a non-trivial Aharonov-Bohm magnetic field leads to a Hardy inequality on a loop graph.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252098","docid":252098,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256539","fileid":1256539,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252098,"filename":"0711.1943.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"024ee838d7982cea5a103db26c8fe58b","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":194057,"mtime":"2017-05-12 16:04:50","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77393/1/0711.1943.pdf"}],"eprintid":77393,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0711.1943.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2007 by the authors.
