{"title":"Nonlinear multiplexing in optical fiber communications","uri":"","abstract":"The nonlinear evolution of a dispersion-managed soliton admits a novel nonlinear multiplexing scheme for optical communications. Information is coded onto the canonical parameters (chirp and width) characterizing the pulse. It is shown that in dispersion-managed fiber communication channels, there exists the possibility of a nonlinear multiplexing scheme, with no linear analog, that effectively multiplies the bit-rate throughput several-fold. Alternatively, the same bit-rate is achieved while relaxing the requirements on the pulse width, so that slower modulation speeds and narrowband in-line filters may be used without paying a penalty in the information-transfer rate. In addition, the scheme is insensitive to minor variations in the multiplexing parameters. The analysis is based on a Hamiltonian reduction of the dispersion-managed nonlinear Schrodinger equation, and is corroborated with direct numerical simulations.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252572","docid":252572,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261524","fileid":1261524,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252572,"filename":"01248503.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"ecdcf02077e4668b38fe2b517dbc2c90","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":254791,"mtime":"2017-05-22 23:06:30","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77637/1/01248503.pdf"}],"eprintid":77637,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01248503.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2003 IEEE. \n\nThe authors are grateful to Dr. B.
