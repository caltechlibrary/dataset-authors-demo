{"title":"Eigenvalues of Schrödinger operators with complex surface potentials","uri":"","abstract":"We consider Schrödinger operators in R^d with complex potentials supported on a hyperplane and show that all eigenvalues lie in a disk in the complex plane with radius bounded in terms of the L^p norm of the potential with d−1 \u003cp ≤ d. We also prove bounds on sums of powers of eigenvalues.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251577","docid":251577,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1251838","fileid":1251838,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251577,"filename":"1512.09067.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"960238ec30c02ee781516acb541c4113","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":186867,"mtime":"2017-05-01 22:59:28","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77111/1/1512.09067.pdf"}],"eprintid":77111,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1512.09067.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2015 by the author.
