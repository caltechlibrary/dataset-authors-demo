{"title":"Degrees of Freedom for the MIMO Interference Channel","uri":"","abstract":"We explore the available degrees of freedom (DoF) for the two user MIMO interference channel, and find a general inner bound and a genie aided outer bound that give us the exact # of DoF in many cases. We also study a share-and-transmit scheme and show how the gains of transmitter cooperation are entirely offset by the cost of enabling that cooperation so that the available DoF are not increased.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252254","docid":252254,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1257677","fileid":1257677,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252254,"filename":"04036207.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"8422b9e0241449d65ccd75cd1d5d6432","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":235748,"mtime":"2017-05-15 23:15:44","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77471/1/04036207.pdf"}],"eprintid":77471,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04036207.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE.","id":77471,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/74/71","datestamp":"2017-05-16 03:18:58","lastmod":"2017-05-16 03:18:58","status_changed":"2017-05-16 03:18:58","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Syed A.","family":"Jafar","id":"Jafar-S-A","orcid":""},{"given":"Maralle J.","family":"Fakhereddin","id":"Fakhereddin-M-J","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-07","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"1452-1456","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170515-161319880","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170515-161319880","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.262087","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4036207/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[1] G.
