{"title":"Retinomorphic Vision Systems II: Communication Channel Design","uri":"","abstract":"I discuss the tradeoffs faced when asynchronous pulse trains are transmitted among  large,  two-dimensional,  arrays of neurons on different chips, using time-division  multiplexing, and present an implementation of an arbitered,  random-access, channel. The long cycle time that plagues \narbitered channels is addressed in the implementation described here by pipelining. Cycle times ranging from \n420ns to 730ns were achieved, for 64 x 64 arrays, in a \n2µm CMOS process, yielding a peak throughput of  2.38M \nspikes/second.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252804","docid":252804,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263610","fileid":1263610,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252804,"filename":"00598465.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"f9b924c87f218ea65d9b04954098df83","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":477189,"mtime":"2017-05-25 23:55:30","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77782/1/00598465.pdf"}],"eprintid":77782,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00598465.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 1996 IEEE. \n\nI thank my advisor,  Carver Mead, for sharing his insights into the operation of the nervous system.
