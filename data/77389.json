{"title":"Ratio asymptotics and weak asymptotic measures for orthogonal polynomials on the real line","uri":"","abstract":"We study ratio asymptotics, that is, existence of the limit of Pn_(+1)(z)/P_n(z) (P_n= monic orthogonal polynomial) and the existence of weak limits of pn^2dμ(p_n=P_n/||P_n||) as n→∞ for orthogonal polynomials on the real line. We show existence of ratio asymptotics at a single z_0 with Im(z_0)≠0 implies dμ is in a Nevai class (i.e., a_n→a and bn→b where a_n,b_n are the off-diagonal and diagonal Jacobi parameters). For μ's with bounded support, we prove pn^2dμ has a weak limit if and only if limb_n, lima_(2n), and lima_(2n+1) all exist. In both cases, we write down the limits explicitly.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252096","docid":252096,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256529","fileid":1256529,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252096,"filename":"1-s2.0-S0021904503002107-main.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"5a9b18f042c563555c675ed660aaa829","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":303143,"mtime":"2017-05-12 15:50:00","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77389/1/1-s2.0-S0021904503002107-main.pdf"}],"eprintid":77389,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"1-s2.0-S0021904503002107-main.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2003 Elsevier Inc. \n\nReceived 10 July 2003, Accepted 1 December 2003, Available online 7 February 2004. \n\nCommunicated by Leonid Golinskii \n\nSupported in part by NSF Grant DMS-0140592.","id":77389,"rev_number":9,"userid":772,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/73/89","datestamp":"2017-05-12 23:52:40","lastmod":"2017-05-12 23:52:40","status_changed":"2017-05-12 23:52:40","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Barry","family":"Simon","id":"Simon-B","orcid":"0000-0003-2561-8539"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"Polynomials; Asymptotics; Jacobi matrices","date":"2004-02","date_type":"inpress","publication":"Journal of Approximation Theory","volume":"126","number":"2","pagerange":"198-217","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170512-073744838","refereed":true,"issn":"0021-9045","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170512-073744838","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jat.2003.12.002","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021904503002107","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[1] N.I.
