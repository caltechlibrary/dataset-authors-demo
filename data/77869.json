{"title":"Large-scale Holographic Memory: Experiment Results","uri":"","abstract":"We describe a holographic optical memory capable of storing  up to 10^12 bits of information. The stored information \nis retrieved in  blocks or pages, each consisting of \n10^3 x 10^3  bits. Each  page  can be accessed randomly in \napproximately 100 µsec with an experimentally  measured SNR \nof 816.8, and a  projected  probability of error of \n10^(-28).
