{"title":"Gas-phase Silicon Etching With Bromine Trifluoride","uri":"","abstract":"We report the first study of gas phase silicon micromachining using pure bromine trifluoride (BrF/sub 3/) gas at room temperature. This work includes both the design of a new apparatus and etching characterization. Consistent etching results and high molecular etching efficiency (80%) have been achieved by performing the etching in a controlled pulse mode. This pure gaseous BrF/sub 3/ etching process is isotropic and has a high etch rate with superb selectivity over silicon dioxide (3000:1), silicon nitride (400-800:1) and photoresist (1000:1). Moreover, gaseous BrF/sub 3/ etching has also been demonstrated in surface micromachining process, where silicon nitride channels and membranes using polysilicon as the sacrificial layer have been successfully fabricated.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252801","docid":252801,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263588","fileid":1263588,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252801,"filename":"00635751.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"743c757e9290e73c59487b4190beba6c","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":496960,"mtime":"2017-05-25 23:27:37","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77777/1/00635751.pdf"}],"eprintid":77777,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00635751.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 1997 IEEE. \n\nThe authors would like to thank Trevor Roper, Larry Begay for help with the system setup and Tomas Tsao, Charles Grosjean with helpful discussions.","id":77777,"rev_number":9,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/77/77","datestamp":"2017-05-26 17:46:06","lastmod":"2017-05-26 17:46:06","status_changed":"2017-05-26 17:46:06","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Xuan-Qi","family":"Wang","id":"Wang-Xuan-Qi","orcid":""},{"given":"Xing","family":"Yang","id":"Yang-Xing","orcid":""},{"given":"Ken","family":"Walsh","id":"Walsh-K","orcid":""},{"given":"Yu-Chong","family":"Tai","id":"Tai-Yu-Chong","orcid":"0000-0001-8529-106X"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"Silicon, Reservoirs, Temperature, Valves, Nitrogen, Safety, Dry etching, Chemical processes, Differential equations, Xenon","date":"1997-06","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"2","number":"","pagerange":"1505-1508","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170525-161134683","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170525-161134683","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSOR.1997.635751","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/635751/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"Xuan-Qi Wang, Xing Yang, K.
