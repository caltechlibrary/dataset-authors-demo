{"title":"Consensus protocols for networks of dynamic agents","uri":"","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce  linear and nonlinear consensus  protocols for networks of dynamic  agents that allow the \nagents to agree in a distributed  and cooperative fashion. \nWe consider the cases of networks with communication time-delays and channels that have filtering effects. \nWe find a tight upper bound  on the maximum fixed time-delay \nthat can be tolerated in the network. It turns out that the \nconnectivity of the network is the key  in reaching a \nconsensus. The case of agreement with bounded inputs is \nconsidered by analyzing the convergence of a class of nonlinear protocols. A Lyapunov function is introduced that \nquantifies the total disagreement among the nodes of a \nnetwork. Simulation results are provided for  agreement  in networks with  communication  time-delays and constrained inputs.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252566","docid":252566,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261446","fileid":1261446,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252566,"filename":"01239709.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"207f1032211507db073203eaacae711a","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":416298,"mtime":"2017-05-22 22:37:36","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77634/1/01239709.pdf"}],"eprintid":77634,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01239709.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2003 IEEE.","id":77634,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/76/34","datestamp":"2017-05-22 22:49:48","lastmod":"2017-05-22 22:49:48","status_changed":"2017-05-22 22:49:48","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Reza Olfati","family":"Saber","id":"Saber-R-O","orcid":""},{"given":"Richard M.","family":"Murray","id":"Murray-R-M","orcid":"0000-0002-5785-7481"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2003-06","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"2","number":"","pagerange":"951-956","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170522-153018041","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170522-153018041","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.2003.1239709","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1239709/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[l] \nA. \nFax \nand \nR.
