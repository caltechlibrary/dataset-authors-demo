{"title":"PCA-based radiative transfer: Improvements to aerosol scheme, vertical layering and spectral binning","uri":"","abstract":"The Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based fast radiative transfer method has been shown to have at least an order of magnitude increase in computational speed while maintaining an overall accuracy of 0.01% (compared to line-by-line calculations) over narrow and broad spectral bands. In this paper, we describe several improvements made to the method and provide a discussion of the method’s performance over a diverse set of atmospheric profiles and land surface types. We also test the model over uniform pressure level profiles. The method is now capable of providing atmospheric spectra with residuals under 0.1%, calculated with respect to the continuum, throughout the shortwave region between 0.3−3μm at high resolution, which is substantial improvement over errors reported in earlier work. Future directions for applications and further optimization are examined.","documents":null,"note":"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd. \n\nReceived 18 February 2017, Revised 8 May 2017, Accepted 8 May 2017, Available online 9 May 2017.","id":77615,"rev_number":6,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/76/15","datestamp":"2017-06-05 20:08:52","lastmod":"2017-06-05 20:08:52","status_changed":"2017-06-05 20:08:52","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Pushkar","family":"Kopparla","id":"Kopparla-P","orcid":""},{"given":"Vijay","family":"Natraj","id":"Natraj-V","orcid":""},{"given":"Drew","family":"Limpasuvan","id":"Limpasuvan-D","orcid":""},{"given":"Robert","family":"Spurr","id":"Spurr-R-J-D","orcid":""},{"given":"David","family":"Crisp","id":"Crisp-D","orcid":""},{"given":"Run-Lie","family":"Shia","id":"Shia-Run-Lie","orcid":""},{"given":"Peter","family":"Somkuti","id":"Somkuti-P","orcid":""},{"given":"Yuk L.","family":"Yung","id":"Yung-Y-L","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-09","date_type":"published","publication":"Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer","volume":"198","number":"","pagerange":"104-111","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170522-075457610","refereed":true,"issn":"0022-4073","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170522-075457610","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2017.05.005","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407317301498","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"Pushkar Kopparla, Vijay Natraj, Drew Limpasuvan, Robert Spurr, David Crisp, Run-Lie Shia, Peter Somkuti, Yuk L Yung, PCA-based radiative transfer: Improvements to aerosol scheme, vertical layering and spectral binning, Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer, Volume 198, September 2017, Pages 104-111, ISSN 0022-4073, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2017.05.005.\n(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407317301498)","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"Gail","local_group":null}
