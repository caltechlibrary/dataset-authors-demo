{"title":"On the Outage Probability of Localization in Randomly Deployed Wireless Networks","uri":"","abstract":"This letter analyzes the localization outage probability (LOP), the probability that the position error exceeds a given threshold, in randomly deployed wireless networks. Two typical cases are considered: a mobile agent uses all the neighboring anchors or selects the best pair of anchors for self-localization. We derive the exact LOP for the former case and tight bounds for the LOP for the latter case. The comparison between the two cases reveals the advantage of anchor selection in terms of LOP versus complexity tradeoff, providing insights into the design of efficient localization systems.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252057","docid":252057,"rev_number":5,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256268","fileid":1256268,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252057,"filename":"07807242.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"464e0fece8036963fbdd31863645aca7","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":508711,"mtime":"2017-05-11 14:56:27","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77366/1/07807242.pdf"}],"eprintid":77366,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"07807242.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252058","docid":252058,"rev_number":5,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256271","fileid":1256271,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252058,"filename":"1703.09453.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"215bfb72f5e10f5c2545ad519ff181c5","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":264689,"mtime":"2017-05-11 15:09:32","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77366/2/1703.09453.pdf"}],"eprintid":77366,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1703.09453.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2017 IEEE. \n\nManuscript received July 4, 2016, revised November 28, 2016, and accepted December 20, 2016.
