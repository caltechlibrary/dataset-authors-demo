{"title":"Quantum Hall Spin Diode","uri":"","abstract":"Double layer two-dimensional electron systems at high perpendicular magnetic field are used to realize magnetic tunnel junctions in which the electrons at the Fermi level in the two layers have either parallel or antiparallel spin magnetizations. In the antiparallel case the tunnel junction, at low temperatures, behaves as a nearly ideal spin diode. At elevated temperatures the diode character degrades as long-wavelength spin waves are thermally excited. These tunnel junctions provide a demonstration that the spin polarization of the electrons in the N=1 Landau level at filling factors ν=5/2 and 7/2 is essentially complete, and, with the aid of an in-plane magnetic field component, that Landau level mixing at these filling factors is weak in the samples studied.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251810","docid":251810,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254265","fileid":1254265,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251810,"filename":"PhysRevLett.118.186801.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"ed30268490ae02ad1c5fbae902912d01","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":295908,"mtime":"2017-05-05 18:06:38","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77221/1/PhysRevLett.118.186801.pdf"}],"eprintid":77221,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"PhysRevLett.118.186801.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251811","docid":251811,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254267","fileid":1254267,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251811,"filename":"1701.04463.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"6b0eea852e7e1134555b7794bb0e162f","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":214644,"mtime":"2017-05-05 18:06:44","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77221/2/1701.04463.pdf"}],"eprintid":77221,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1701.04463.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2017 American Physical Society. \n\nReceived 18 January 2017; published 4 May 2017. \n\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge helpful discussions with P. A.

While layer density imbalance in the bilayer 2DES might be responsible, the imbalance required is inconsistent with the precision balancing of the sample provided by gate tuning the tunnel resonance at zero magnetic field and the lack of any detectable beating in the magneto-oscillations of the tunnel conductance at low magnetic field.\n26.Provided that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the 2D planes.\n27.Both disorder and electron-electron interactions can enable inter-LL tunneling.\n28.J.
