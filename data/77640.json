{"title":"A server allocation and placement algorithm for content distribution","uri":"","abstract":"It is well known that optimal server placement is NP-hard. We present an approximate model for the case when both clients and servers are dense, and propose a simple server allocation and placement algorithm based on high-rate vector quantization theory. The key idea is to regard the location of a request as a random variable with probability density that is proportional to the demand at that location, and the problem of server placement as source coding, i.e., to optimally map a source value (request location) to a codeword (server location) to minimize distortion (network cost). This view has led to a joint server allocation and placement algorithm that has a time-complexity that is linear in the number of clients. Simulations are presented to illustrate its performance.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252575","docid":252575,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261585","fileid":1261585,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252575,"filename":"01115407.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"54ba38af4c4ad227955df8f4a175bd3e","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":234394,"mtime":"2017-05-22 23:47:04","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77640/1/01115407.pdf"}],"eprintid":77640,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01115407.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2002 IEEE. \n\nThis work was supported by Caltech Lee Center for Advanced Networking and Yuen Research Fund.","id":77640,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/76/40","datestamp":"2017-05-22 23:49:15","lastmod":"2017-05-22 23:49:15","status_changed":"2017-05-22 23:49:15","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Craig","family":"Cameron","id":"Cameron-C-W","orcid":""},{"given":"Steven H.","family":"Low","id":"Low-S-H","orcid":""},{"given":"David X.","family":"Wei","id":"Wei-David-X","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2002-10","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"26-28","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170522-162939354","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170522-162939354","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2002.1115407","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1115407/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[l] \nCraig \nW. \nCameron, \nSteven \nH. \nLow, \nand \nDavid \nX. \nWei, \n“High- \ndensity \nmodel \nfor \nwryer \nallocation \nand \nplacement,” \nIn \nPd- \nings \nof \nA CM \nSigmetrics, \nMarina \ndel \nbyp \nCA, \nJune \n2002. \n[2] \nJ. \nKangaharju, \nK. \nW. \nRoss, \nand \nJ.W. \nRoberts, \n“Locating \ncopies \nof \nobjects  using the \ndomain  name \nsystem,” \nIn \nProceed- \nings \nof \nthe \n4th \nInternationel \nCaching \nWorkshop, \nMarch \n1999. \n[3] \n0. \nKariv \nand \nS. \nL. \nHakimi, \n“An algorithmic \napproach \nto \nnet- \nwork \nlocation  problems. \nII: \nthe \npmedians,” \nSIAM \nJ. \nAwl. \nMath., \n37(3):53M, \nDecember \n1979. \n[4] \nBalachander Krishnamurthy \nand \nJia \nWang, \n“On \nnetwork-aware \nclustering \nof \nweb \nclients,” \nIn \nProceedings \nof \nACM \nSIGCOMM \n2000, \nAugust \n2000. \n[5] \nC. \nPapadimitriou, \n“Worst-case \nand  probabilistic analysis \nof \na \ngeometric \nlocation  problem,” \nSIAM \nJ. \nCornput., \n10542-557, \n1981. \n[6] \nA. \nShaikh, \nR. \nTe\u0026, \nand \nM. \nAgrawal, \n“On \nthe \neffectiveness \nof \nDNS-based \nserver \nselection,” \nIn \nPmceedings \nof \nIEEE \nInfocorn, \nApril \n2001.
