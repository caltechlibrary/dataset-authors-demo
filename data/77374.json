{"title":"On the Achievable Throughput in Two-Scale Wireless Networks","uri":"","abstract":"We propose a new model of wireless networks which we refer to as \"two-scale networks\". At a local scale, characterized by nodes being within a distance r, channel strengths are drawn independently and identically from a distance-independent distribution. At a global scale, characterized by nodes being further apart from each other than a distance r, channel connections are governed by a Rayleigh distribution, with the power satisfying a distance-based decay law. Thus, at a local scale, channel strengths are determined primarily by random effects such as obstacles and scatterers whereas at the global scale channel strengths depend on distance. \n\nFor such networks, we propose a hybrid communications scheme, combining elements of P. Gupta et al. (2000) (for distance-dependent networks) and R. Gowaikar et al. (2006) (for random networks). For a particular class of two-scale networks with N nodes, we show that an aggregate throughput of the form N^(1/(t-1)) / (log^2 N) is achievable, where t \u003e 2 is a parameter that depends on the distribution of the connection at the local scale and is independent of the decay law that operates at a global scale. For t \u003c 3, this offers a significant improvement over the O(√N) results of P. Gupta et al. (2000).","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252067","docid":252067,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256344","fileid":1256344,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252067,"filename":"04036254.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"8bf33cd5841fd6cdc9ebc1112ed36ea7","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":232344,"mtime":"2017-05-11 19:50:08","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77374/1/04036254.pdf"}],"eprintid":77374,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04036254.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE. \n\nThis work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant nos.
