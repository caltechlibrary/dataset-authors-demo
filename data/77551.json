{"title":"Stability and auctions in labor markets with job security","uri":"","abstract":"Fu et al. (2016) introduced a stability concept for labor markets with job security. We show that their proposed outcomes form Nash equilibria of an auction where firms compete for workers. This parallels literature on stable outcomes and similar auctions, and yields new price of anarchy bounds.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252427","docid":252427,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1259416","fileid":1259416,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252427,"filename":"1-s2.0-S0165176517300794-main.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"464e55fa897006b5e3faf1bbdb1a8e10","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":406675,"mtime":"2017-05-18 15:09:54","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77551/1/1-s2.0-S0165176517300794-main.pdf"}],"eprintid":77551,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"1-s2.0-S0165176517300794-main.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252440","docid":252440,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1259481","fileid":1259481,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252440,"filename":"SPIB-V4.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"14ce3f6d1cbcb46721413e6191e59cdd","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":286593,"mtime":"2017-05-18 16:18:08","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77551/2/SPIB-V4.pdf"}],"eprintid":77551,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"SPIB-V4.pdf","content":"accepted"}],"note":"© 2017 Elsevier B.V. \n\nReceived 29 October 2016.
