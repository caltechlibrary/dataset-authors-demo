{"title":"Co-supported tandem catalysts for production of linear low density polyethylene","uri":"","abstract":"A phenoxy-imine titanium trimerization catalyst and a silylene linked cyclopentadienyl-amido titanium polymn.\ncatalyst are co-immobilized on methylaluminoxane/silica particles to create a tandem catalytic system to generate linear low d. polyethylene (LLDPE) from an ethylene only feed. The 1-hexene incorporation into the polymer can be controlled by varying the ethylene pressure.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251643","docid":251643,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252775","fileid":1252775,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251643,"filename":"Aluthge_2017pINOR-1449.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"403e45344a55f026662e4f1d777d6cf4","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":88543,"mtime":"2017-05-03 16:27:17","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77139/1/Aluthge_2017pINOR-1449.pdf"}],"eprintid":77139,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Aluthge_2017pINOR-1449.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77139,"rev_number":8,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/39","datestamp":"2017-05-03 18:17:40","lastmod":"2017-05-03 18:17:40","status_changed":"2017-05-03 18:17:40","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Dinesh","family":"Aluthge","id":"Aluthge-D-C","orcid":""},{"given":"Aaron","family":"Sattler","id":"Sattler-A","orcid":""},{"given":"John E.","family":"Bercaw","id":"Bercaw-J-E","orcid":""},{"given":"Jay A.","family":"Labinger","id":"Labinger-J-A","orcid":"0000-0002-1942-9232"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"INOR-1449","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-092710803","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-092710803","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
