{"title":"Successful entrepreneurship means knowing how business decisions get made","uri":"","abstract":"My interaction with an engineer who came to me to raise capital to start his software company provides me an opportunity to recap some of the points I have made in years past (see sidebar, \"A reminder for entrepreneurs\"). I am describing it here, even though the business is unrelated to photonics—the generalizations we can draw from this experience are useful for any high-tech business. I will first present it as a case study, and then provide commentary to summarize how one can minimize startup risk if you ever decide to become an entrepreneur.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252766","docid":252766,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263153","fileid":1263153,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252766,"filename":"Chang_2017p54.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"412ba92389887e466aab49ddd66da6c7","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":411184,"mtime":"2017-05-25 17:23:25","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77753/1/Chang_2017p54.pdf"}],"eprintid":77753,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Chang_2017p54.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2017 PennWell Corporation.","id":77753,"rev_number":11,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/77/53","datestamp":"2017-05-25 18:07:40","lastmod":"2017-05-25 18:07:40","status_changed":"2017-05-25 18:07:40","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Milton","family":"Chang","id":"Chang-Milton","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"Laser Focus World","volume":"53","number":"4","pagerange":"54-56","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170525-102320647","refereed":true,"issn":"1043-8092","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170525-102320647","related_url":[{"url":"http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/print/volume-53/issue-04/columns/business-forum/business-forum-successful-entrepreneurship-means-knowing-how-business-decisions-get-made.html","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
