{"title":"On the Zeros of Functions in the Bers Space","uri":"","abstract":"We present some results on the distribution of zeros of functions in the Bers space Q(D), showing how the distribution depends on the bounds of the growth of │ƒ(z)│ HS │z│ƒ → 1, for ƒ Є Q(D). We also exhibit an open and dense subset, M C Q(D), which has the property of uniform control over the number of zeros in disks of hyperbolic radius l containes in D.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251875","docid":251875,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254962","fileid":1254962,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251875,"filename":"0350-13020475185F.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"d7bf6e84ae08ed0a24de73d9b20539cb","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":263019,"mtime":"2017-05-08 13:58:21","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77247/1/0350-13020475185F.pdf"}],"eprintid":77247,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0350-13020475185F.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252371","docid":252371,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1258850","fileid":1258850,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252371,"filename":"FM.ps","mime_type":"application/postscript","hash":"67372c4c041032bf7da3b624f1556d20","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":203533,"mtime":"2017-05-17 19:36:12","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77247/2/FM.ps"}],"eprintid":77247,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/postscript","format":"application/postscript","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"FM.ps","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2004 l'Institut Mathématique. \n\nReceived October 20, 2003.
