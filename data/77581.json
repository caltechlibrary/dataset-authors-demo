{"title":"Integrated surface-micromachined mass flow controller","uri":"","abstract":"An integrated surface-micromachined mass flow controller (MFC) that consists of an electrostatically actuated microvalve and a thermal flow sensor is presented here. With a unique design and utilizing a multilayer Parylene process, the active microvalve and the flow sensor are integrated onto a single chip to perform closed-loop flow control. Sensitivity of the flow sensor is 55 μV/(μ/L/min) for airflow and 12.2 μV/(nL/min) for water. The valve is actuated with a 10 kHz AC signal and an applied pressure of 21 kPa can be sealed with an actuation voltage of 200 V_peak (±200 V). For flow control, both Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and actuation voltage adjustment are demonstrated. PWM shows better performance in terms of controllability and linearity.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252471","docid":252471,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1259869","fileid":1259869,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252471,"filename":"01189677.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"65d350b7060f89d944061c6bb09eabc3","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":342879,"mtime":"2017-05-18 20:05:07","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77581/1/01189677.pdf"}],"eprintid":77581,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01189677.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2003 IEEE. \n\nThis work is supported in part by NSF ERC Center at Caltech (Grant No. EEC-9402726) and DARPA/MTO Bioflips Program.
