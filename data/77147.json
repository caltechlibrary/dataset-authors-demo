{"title":"Metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of alkyl electrophiles","uri":"","abstract":"Despite the tremendous accomplishments that have been described in the development of transition metal-catalyzed\ncoupling processes, it is nevertheless true that many significant opportunities remain. For example, to date the overwhelming majority of studies have focused on couplings between two sp -hybridized reaction sites (e.g., an aryl metal with an aryl halide). As of 2001, there were relatively few examples of metal-catalyzed coupling reactions of alkyl electrophiles. During the past decade, we have pursued the discovery of transition metal-based catalysts for coupling activated and unactivated alkyl\nelectrophiles that bear β hydrogens. Our recent efforts to develop broadly applicable methods, including enantioselective processes, will be discussed.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251649","docid":251649,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252823","fileid":1252823,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251649,"filename":"Fu_2017pORGN-1.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"3fff83fefcd1b10fb2d75c1bcc473426","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":118614,"mtime":"2017-05-03 17:19:53","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77147/1/Fu_2017pORGN-1.pdf"}],"eprintid":77147,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Fu_2017pORGN-1.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77147,"rev_number":8,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/47","datestamp":"2017-05-03 18:14:33","lastmod":"2017-05-03 18:14:33","status_changed":"2017-05-03 18:14:33","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Gregory C.","family":"Fu","id":"Fu-G-C","orcid":"0000-0002-0927-680X"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"ORGN-1","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-101947409","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-101947409","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
