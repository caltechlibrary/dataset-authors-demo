{"title":"Testing Fundamental Properties of Space with the Fermilab Holometer","uri":"","abstract":"Precision length measurements provide valuable insights about the fundamental properties of space-time. The Holometer is a research program to both experimentally probe signatures of the Planck scale and to extend the accessible frequency range from kHz up to MHz for gravitational wave searches. The instrument consists of separate yet identical 39-meter Michelson interferometers operated at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, which can reach length sensitivities better than 10^(-20)m/√Hz within the 1-10 MHz frequency range. The Holometer is fully operational with 130 of hours of science quality data obtained during the first observational campaign.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253068","docid":253068,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265810","fileid":1265810,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253068,"filename":"Kamai_2017_J._Phys.%3A_Conf._Ser._840_012055.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"8271ca3887dcfb9b9667f51c18a94e10","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":234094,"mtime":"2017-06-02 16:51:47","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77912/1/Kamai_2017_J._Phys.%253A_Conf._Ser._840_012055.pdf"}],"eprintid":77912,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"Kamai_2017_J._Phys.%3A_Conf._Ser._840_012055.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.
