{"title":"Capacity of Two-Layer Networks with Binary Weights","uri":"","abstract":"The capacity C_b of two later (N - 2L - 1) feed-forward neural networks is shown to satisfy the relation O(W/(lnW)) ≤ C ≤ O(W). Here N - 2L - 1 stands for the networks with N input units, 2L hidden units and one output unit. W is the total number of weights of the networks. The weights take only binary values and the hidden units have integer thresholds.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252809","docid":252809,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263645","fileid":1263645,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252809,"filename":"00748750.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"8510ebd8b8398424004c9b3fdb1b39e8","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":118502,"mtime":"2017-05-26 00:42:29","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77787/1/00748750.pdf"}],"eprintid":77787,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00748750.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 1993 IEEE.","id":77787,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/77/87","datestamp":"2017-05-26 17:18:58","lastmod":"2017-05-26 17:18:58","status_changed":"2017-05-26 17:18:58","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Chuanyi","family":"Ji","id":"Ji-Chuanyi","orcid":""},{"given":"Demetri","family":"Psaltis","id":"Psaltis-D","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"1993-01","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"434-434","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170525-173839521","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170525-173839521","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1993.748750","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/748750/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"Chuanyi Ji and D.
