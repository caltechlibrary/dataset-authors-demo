{"title":"A broadband self-consistent modelling of the X-ray spectrum of 4U 1626–67","uri":"","abstract":"The accretion-powered X-ray pulsar 4U 1626--67 is one of the few highly  \nmagnetized pulsars that accretes through Roche-lobe overflow from a low-mass \ncompanion. The characteristics of its broadband spectrum are similar to those  \nof X-ray pulsars hosted in a high-mass X-ray binary systems, with a broad  \nresonant cyclotron scattering feature (CRSF) at ~37 keV. In this work, we \nexamine the pulse-resolved and the pulse-averaged broadband spectrum using data \nfrom NuSTAR and Swift. We use the Becker \u0026 Wolff model of bulk+thermal \nComptonization to infer key physical parameters of the accretion column flow \nand a broadband model for the disk reflected spectrum. In the softer X-ray\nband, we need to add a soft black-body component with kT_(bb) ~0.5 \nkeV, whose characteristics indicate a possible origin from the neutron star \nsurface. Residuals suggest that the shape of the cyclotron line could be more\nsatisfactorily fitted using a narrow core and broader wings and, at higher \nenergies, a second harmonic could be present at ~61 keV.\n","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252063","docid":252063,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256307","fileid":1256307,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252063,"filename":"1705.03404.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"10e999ab3d4045041e1aea1fb852d8ef","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":731814,"mtime":"2017-05-11 17:11:00","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77370/1/1705.03404.pdf"}],"eprintid":77370,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1705.03404.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"Accepted 2017 May 09.
