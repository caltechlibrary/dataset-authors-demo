{"title":"Cyclic Low-Density MDS Array Codes","uri":"","abstract":"We construct two infinite families of low density MDS array codes which are also cyclic. One of these families includes the first such sub-family with redundancy parameter r \u003e 2. The two constructions have different algebraic formulations, though they both have the same indirect structure. First MDS codes that are not cyclic are constructed and then by applying a certain mapping to their parity check matrices, non-equivalent cyclic codes with the same distance and density properties are obtained. Using the same proof techniques, a third infinite family of quasi-cyclic codes can be constructed.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252338","docid":252338,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1258551","fileid":1258551,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252338,"filename":"04036482.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"fb6f873503a6d22b1171feec45a9f605","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":220858,"mtime":"2017-05-16 23:45:26","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77510/1/04036482.pdf"}],"eprintid":77510,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04036482.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE. \n\nThis work was supported in part by the Caltech Lee Center for Advanced Networking and by NSF grant ANI-0322475.","id":77510,"rev_number":9,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/75/10","datestamp":"2017-05-16 23:57:05","lastmod":"2017-05-16 23:57:05","status_changed":"2017-05-16 23:57:05","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Yuval","family":"Cassuto","id":"Cassuto-Y","orcid":""},{"given":"Jehoshua","family":"Bruck","id":"Bruck-J","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-07","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"2794-2798","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170516-163950291","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170516-163950291","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261571","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4036482/","type":"pub","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechPARADISE:2006.ETR076","type":"related","description":"Technical Report"}],"referencetext":["1] G.V Zaitsev, V.A Zinov’ev, and N.V Semakov.
