{"title":"Hidden Simplicity of the Gravity Action","uri":"","abstract":"We derive new representations of the Einstein-Hilbert action in which\ngraviton perturbation theory is immensely simplified. To accomplish this, we\nrecast the Einstein-Hilbert action as a theory of purely cubic interactions\namong gravitons and a single auxiliary field. The corresponding equations of\nmotion are the Einstein field equations rewritten as two coupled first-order\ndifferential equations. Since all Feynman diagrams are cubic, we are able to\nderive new off-shell recursion relations for tree-level graviton scattering\namplitudes. With a judicious choice of gauge fixing, we then construct an\nespecially compact form for the Einstein-Hilbert action in which all graviton\ninteractions are simply proportional to the graviton kinetic term. Our results\napply to graviton perturbations about an arbitrary curved background spacetime.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251737","docid":251737,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1253680","fileid":1253680,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251737,"filename":"1705.00626.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"46fed824a46f74bd652bed5b92e72f4e","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":491191,"mtime":"2017-05-04 19:32:55","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77198/1/1705.00626.pdf"}],"eprintid":77198,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1705.00626.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"We thank Sean Carroll and Leo Stein for useful discussions and comments.
