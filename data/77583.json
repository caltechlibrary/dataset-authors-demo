{"title":"Icemaker^(TM): an excel-based environment for collaborative design","uri":"","abstract":"The creative process of team design can be rapid and  powerful when focused, yet complex designs, such as \nspacecrafit, can slow and quench the essential elements \nof this process. Concurrent Engineering techniques  partially address this problem, but a fuller realization \nof their benefits require an approach centering on \nthe human aspects of teamwork. ICEMaker^(TM) \nis a Microsoft Excel® based software tool that \nfacilitates closer-to-ideal collaboration within teams  employing the new Integrated Concurrent Engineering \n(ICE) methodology. ICE is a generic approach that  emphasizes focused collaborative design in a single-room  context, and is now employed at several aerospace organizations to increase the productivity of design teams \ndefining complex early development-phase products. By \nway of introduction, this paper describes the basic elements \nof ICE needed to understand ICEMaker and its application. \nWe present the design approach, philosophy, and client-server architecture of the ICEMaker system, as well as a \nsimplified user scenario. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory \n(JPL) has recently adopted ICEMaker for its primary  early-phase space mission and system advanced project  design team, Team-X. We describe Team-X's experience with \nICEMaker and report on the lessons learned, and qualitative \nproduct improvements, resulting from JPL's implementation \nof ICEMaker.
