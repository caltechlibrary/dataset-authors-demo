{"title":"Unified eigenfilter approach: with applications to spectral/spatial filtering","uri":"","abstract":"The eigenfilter approach is extended to solve general least-squares approximation problems with linear constraints. Such extension unifies previous work in eigenfilters and many other filter design problems, including spectral/spatial filtering, one-dimensional or multidimensional filters, data independent or statistically optimal filtering, etc. With this approach, various filter design problems are transformed into problems of finding an eigenvector of a positive definite matrix that is determined by filter design specifications. This approach has the advantage that many filter design constraints can be incorporated easily. A number of design examples are presented to show the usefulness and flexibility of the proposed approach.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253238","docid":253238,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1266996","fileid":1266996,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253238,"filename":"00393725.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"203a936e8e017b16bb97b3fb37ab155e","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":352672,"mtime":"2017-06-06 00:52:42","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77956/1/00393725.pdf"}],"eprintid":77956,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00393725.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 1993 IEEE. \n\nWork supported in parts by the NSF grant MIP 5919196, and \nby matching funds from Tektronix,  Inc., and Rockwell \nInternational.
