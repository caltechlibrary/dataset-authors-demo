{"title":"Large-eddy simulation of flow over a cylinder with Re_D from to 3.9 x 10^3 to 8.5 x 10^5: a skin-friction perspective","uri":"","abstract":"We present wall-resolved large-eddy simulations (LES) of flow over a smooth-wall circular cylinder up to Re_D = 8.5 × 10^5, where Re_D is Reynolds number based on the cylinder diameter D and the free-stream speed U_∞. The stretched-vortex subgrid-scale (SGS) model is used in the entire simulation domain. For the sub-critical regime, six cases are implemented with 3.9 × 10^3 ⩽ Re_D ⩽ 10^5. Results are compared with experimental data for both the wall-pressure-coefficient distribution on the cylinder surface, which dominates the drag coefficient, and the skin-friction coefficient, which clearly correlates with the separation behaviour. In the super-critical regime, LES for three values of Re_D are carried out at different resolutions. The drag-crisis phenomenon is well captured. For lower resolution, numerical discretization fluctuations are sufficient to stimulate transition, while for higher resolution, an applied boundary-layer perturbation is found to be necessary to stimulate transition. Large-eddy simulation results at Re_D = 8.5 × 10^5, with a mesh of 8192 × 1024 × 256, agree well with the classic experimental measurements of Achenbach (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 34, 1968, pp. 625–639) especially for the skin-friction coefficient, where a spike is produced by the laminar–turbulent transition on the top of a prior separation bubble. We document the properties of the attached-flow boundary layer on the cylinder surface as these vary with ReDReD . Within the separated portion of the flow, mean-flow separation–reattachment bubbles are observed at some values of Re_D, with separation characteristics that are consistent with experimental observations. Time sequences of instantaneous surface portraits of vector skin-friction trajectory fields indicate that the unsteady counterpart of a mean-flow separation–reattachment bubble corresponds to the formation of local flow-reattachment cells, visible as coherent bundles of diverging surface streamlines.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253049","docid":253049,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265719","fileid":1265719,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253049,"filename":"largeeddy_simulation_of_flow_over_a_cylinder_with_red_from_39times_103_to_85times_105_a_skinfriction_perspective.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"fca5c7b977104001f198b0a306cde918","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":2538285,"mtime":"2017-06-02 15:47:24","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77907/1/largeeddy_simulation_of_flow_over_a_cylinder_with_red_from_39times_103_to_85times_105_a_skinfriction_perspective.pdf"}],"eprintid":77907,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"largeeddy_simulation_of_flow_over_a_cylinder_with_red_from_39times_103_to_85times_105_a_skinfriction_perspective.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2017 Cambridge University Press. \n\nReceived 11 October 2016; revised 14 March 2017; accepted 14 March 2017; Published online: 05 May 2017. \n\nW.C. and R.S. were supported by the KAUST Office of Competitive Research Funds (OCRF) under award no.
