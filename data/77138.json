{"title":"Microwave Dielectric Properties of (1-x)Ba_(3.75)Nd_(9.5)Cr_(0.25)Nb_(0.25)Ti_(17.5)O_(54)-x NdAlO_3 Ceramics","uri":"","abstract":"This study presents the microwave dielectric properties calculation of (1-x)Ba_(3.75)Nd_(9.5)Cr_(0.25)Nb_(0.25)Ti_(17.5)O_(54)–xNdAlO_3 ceramics where x denotes the volume molar fraction. From X-ray diffraction results, the solid solution limit is calculated to be about 0.76, where it forms a single BaNd_2Ti_4O_(12) phase in Region I (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.76), and both BaNd_2Ti_4O_(12) and NdAlO_3 coexist in Region II (0.76 \u003c x \u003c 1). The solid solution limit is confirmed by independently calculating it from the dielectric constant data. There is less than 4% deviation between the measured dielectric constant (ε_r) and the one calculated from the Maxwell-Wagner formula. The total quality factor (Q) remains almost constant in Region I and increases rapidly with the volume molar fraction of NdAlO_3 in Region II. The measured Q×f, where f is the resonant frequency, is also consistent with the calculated value in both regions. The temperature coefficient at the resonant frequency is -1.4 ppm/oC, which agrees well with the calculated value of 0 ppm/oC. In addition, we observed a close correlation between the bulk density and the phase evolution.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251641","docid":251641,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252760","fileid":1252760,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251641,"filename":"jace14958.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"5e1193fac9017c1f8cb106de339a000d","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1320292,"mtime":"2017-05-03 15:59:11","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77138/1/jace14958.pdf"}],"eprintid":77138,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"jace14958.pdf","content":"accepted"}],"note":"© 2017 John Wiley \u0026 Sons, Inc. \n\nAccepted manuscript online: 2 May 2017. \n\nHetuo Chen gratefully acknowledges support from the China Scholarship Council (CSC, 201506070064) during a visit to the California Institute of Technology.
