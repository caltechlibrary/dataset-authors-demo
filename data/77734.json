{"title":"Experimental demonstration of a holographic memory with a surface density of 100 bits/(µm^2)","uri":"","abstract":"The next generation compact disc due in early 1997, the Digital-Video-Disc (DVD), will have a capacity of ~6 Gbytes per layer, for a maximum planned capacity of ~20 Gbytes per double-sided disk with two layers on each side. That translates to a surface density of approximately 20 bits/(µm^2) for the four-layered DVD disk. In order for holographic three-dimensional disks to be competitive, we must demonstrate a much higher surface density than the most advanced DVD.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252733","docid":252733,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1262872","fileid":1262872,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252733,"filename":"00602155.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"6e926791b848cbba8f2e0def6bafd755","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":320347,"mtime":"2017-05-24 22:52:36","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77734/1/00602155.pdf"}],"eprintid":77734,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00602155.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 1997 Optical Society of America.","id":77734,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/77/34","datestamp":"2017-05-25 19:11:25","lastmod":"2017-05-25 19:11:25","status_changed":"2017-05-25 19:11:25","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Allen","family":"Pu","id":"Pu-Allen","orcid":""},{"given":"Demetri","family":"Psaltis","id":"Psaltis-D","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"1997-05","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"paper CMB1","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170524-154424754","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170524-154424754","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=cleo-1997-CMB1","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["1. \nD. \nPsaltis, M. \nLevene, \nA. \nPu, \nG. \nBarbasta- \nthis, \nK. \nCurtis, \nOpt. \nLett. \n20,782 \n(1995)"],"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"A.
