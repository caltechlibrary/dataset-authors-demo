{"title":"Gowers' Ramsey Theorem for generalized tetris operations","uri":"","abstract":"We prove a generalization of Gowers' theorem for FIN_k where, instead of the single tetris operation T:FIN_k→FIN_(k−1), one considers all maps from FIN_k to FIN_j for 0≤j≤k arising from nondecreasing surjections f:{0,1,…,k}→{0,1,…,j}. This answers a question of Bartošová and Kwiatkowska. We also describe how to prove a common generalization of such a result and the Galvin–Glazer–Hindman theorem on finite products, in the setting of layered partial semigroups introduced by Farah, Hindman, and McLeod.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251397","docid":251397,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1249949","fileid":1249949,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251397,"filename":"1603.09365.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"6644019db386347bff244d73c5f8597b","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":168167,"mtime":"2017-04-27 18:35:24","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77008/1/1603.09365.pdf"}],"eprintid":77008,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1603.09365.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2017 Elsevier Inc. \n\nReceived 6 April 2016, Available online 20 February 2017. \n\nWe are grateful to David Fernandez, Aleksandra Kwiatkowska, Sławomir Solecki, and Kostas Tyros for their comment and suggestions.
