{"title":"Kernel level speculative DSM","uri":"","abstract":"Interprocess communication (IPC) is ubiquitous in today's computing world. One of the simplest mechanisms for IPC is shared memory. We present a system that enhances the System V IPC API to support distributed shared memory (DSM) by using speculations. Speculations provide performance improvements by enabling rollback of overly optimistic speculative executions. This paper describes a speculative total order communication protocol, a speculative sequential consistency model, and a speculative distributed locking mechanism. All these are supported by a mathematical model showing the advantages of speculative execution over traditional execution. Our DSM system is part of the Mojave system, which consists of a compiler and the extensions of the operating system designed to support speculations and process migration. The goal of our system is to provide a simpler programming paradigm for designers of distributed systems.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252470","docid":252470,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1259850","fileid":1259850,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252470,"filename":"01199405.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"10624e9d2f8af009bbc52c9e265cbd22","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":335934,"mtime":"2017-05-18 19:53:44","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77580/1/01199405.pdf"}],"eprintid":77580,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01199405.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2003 IEEE. \n\nThis work was supported by the DARPA, grant F33615-98-C3613 and ASCI/ASAP, grant W-7405-ENG-48.","id":77580,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/75/80","datestamp":"2017-05-18 19:56:53","lastmod":"2017-05-18 19:56:53","status_changed":"2017-05-18 19:56:53","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Cristian","family":"Ţăpuş","id":"Ţăpuş-C","orcid":""},{"given":"Justin D.","family":"Smith","id":"Smith-J-D","orcid":""},{"given":"Jason","family":"Hickey","id":"Hickey-J","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2003-05","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"487-494","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170518-124853920","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170518-124853920","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCGRID.2003.1199405","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1199405/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["1] J.
