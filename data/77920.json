We combined tDCS\nwith psychological therapy to determine whether tDCS of the\nDLPFC could enhance therapeutic outcome in depression.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253087","docid":253087,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1266015","fileid":1266015,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253087,"filename":"PIIS0006322317311769.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"767f46c5bb4b82ceaf486908b861bed6","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":62352,"mtime":"2017-06-02 19:53:26","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77920/1/PIIS0006322317311769.pdf"}],"eprintid":77920,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"PIIS0006322317311769.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc. \n\nSupported By: NARSAD; Wellcome Trust; Brain Research Trust.","id":77920,"rev_number":9,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/79/20","datestamp":"2017-06-02 21:03:19","lastmod":"2017-06-02 21:03:19","status_changed":"2017-06-02 21:03:19","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Camilla","family":"Nord","id":"Nord-C","orcid":""},{"given":"D.
