{"title":"Bo G. Malmström (1927–2000)","uri":"","abstract":"We lost a great scientist and a dear friend on 9 February this year. Bo Malmström (see Photograph) was a very special person: he was passionate about everything he did, and he did many things. I can only cover a few of his activities in this tribute. Note that Bo himself wrote a much more thorough account in his article ‘A Life with the Metals of Life’ – it is a good read.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253229","docid":253229,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1266936","fileid":1266936,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253229,"filename":"1-s2.0-S0968000400016182-main.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"a066e356b3d4c7d52754e0ba683b186a","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":85021,"mtime":"2017-06-05 22:44:33","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77948/1/1-s2.0-S0968000400016182-main.pdf"}],"eprintid":77948,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"1-s2.0-S0968000400016182-main.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. \n\nAvailable online 2 August 2000.","id":77948,"rev_number":8,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/79/48","datestamp":"2017-06-06 18:48:03","lastmod":"2017-06-06 18:48:03","status_changed":"2017-06-06 18:48:03","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Harry B.","family":"Gray","id":"Gray-H-B","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"Copper; Zinc; Laccase; Manganese","date":"2000-08-01","date_type":"published","publication":"Trends in Biochemical Sciences","volume":"25","number":"8","pagerange":"351-352","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170605-154429261","refereed":true,"issn":"0968-0004","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170605-154429261","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0968-0004(00)01618-2","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000400016182?via%3Dihub","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["1B.G.
