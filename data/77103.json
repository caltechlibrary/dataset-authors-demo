{"title":"Entropy and the Uncertainty Principle","uri":"","abstract":"We generalize, improve and unify theorems of Rumin, and Maassen–Uffink about classical entropies associated with quantum density matrices. These theorems refer to the classical entropies of the diagonals of a density matrix in two different bases. Thus, they provide a kind of uncertainty principle. Our inequalities are sharp because they are exact in the high-temperature or semi-classical limit.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251542","docid":251542,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1251522","fileid":1251522,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251542,"filename":"art%3A10.1007%2Fs00023-012-0175-y.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"745ef7c121e11117e7c97f732eec2899","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":177934,"mtime":"2017-05-01 18:13:10","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77103/2/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00023-012-0175-y.pdf"}],"eprintid":77103,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"art%3A10.1007%2Fs00023-012-0175-y.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251543","docid":251543,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1251527","fileid":1251527,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251543,"filename":"1109.1209.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"72eb71dc565063866ca7b2dd3ca1dc56","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":117322,"mtime":"2017-05-01 18:14:40","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77103/3/1109.1209.pdf"}],"eprintid":77103,"pos":3,"placement":3,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1109.1209.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2012 The Author.
