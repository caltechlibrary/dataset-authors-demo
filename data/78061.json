{"title":"Viscous Cahn–Hilliard Equation II. Analysis","uri":"","abstract":"The viscous Cahn–Hilliard equation may be viewed as a singular limit of the phase-field equations for phase transitions. It contains both the Allen–Cahn and Cahn–Hilliard models of phase separation as particular cases; by specific choices of parameters it may be formulated as a one-parameter (sayα) homotopy connecting the Cahn–Hilliard (α=0) and Allen–Cahn (α=1) models. The limitα=0 is singular in the sense that the smoothing property of the analytic semigroup changes from being of the type associated with second order operators to the type associated with fourth order operators. The properties of the gradient dynamical system generated by the viscous Cahn–Hilliard equation are studied asαvaries in [0, 1]. Continuity of the phase portraits near equilibria is established independently ofα∈[0, 1] and, using this, a piecewise, uniform in time, perturbation result is proved for trajectories. Finally the continuity of the attractor is established and, in one dimension, the existence and continuity of inertial manifolds shown and the flow on the attractor detailed.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253443","docid":253443,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1268515","fileid":1268515,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253443,"filename":"1-s2.0-S0022039696901011-main.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"9df7d273ae4ce6ebe7f7a5ade8bbff66","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":803737,"mtime":"2017-06-09 19:59:34","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/78061/1/1-s2.0-S0022039696901011-main.pdf"}],"eprintid":78061,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"1-s2.0-S0022039696901011-main.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 1996 Academic Press. \n\nReceived 2 December 1994, Revised 19 April 1995. \n\nThe authors are very grateful to the referee for an extremely helpful and careful reading of an earlier version of this paper.
