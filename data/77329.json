{"title":"Organocatalytic Vinyl and Friedel−Crafts Alkylations with Trifluoroborate Salts","uri":"","abstract":"Herein we report the first use of vinyl and heteroaryl trifluoroborate salts as viable substrates for amine-catalyzed conjugate additions. The application of LUMO-lowering iminium catalysis has enabled the highly regio- and enantioselective 1,4-addition of rationally designed trifluoroborate salt nucleophiles to α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Imidazolidinone 2•HCl was found to catalyze the addition of various BF_3K-derived heteroaryl and vinyl species to a range of enals with excellent levels of enantioselectivity. Importantly, the use of these salts can enable nontraditional regiocontrol as part of a Friedel−Crafts pathway. Boronic acids can also be employed as viable π-nucleophiles for these asymmetric conjugate additions provided that in situ activation to the corresponding boronate species is accomplished. While BF_3K salts are routinely employed in transition metal catalysis, to our knowledge, this is the first use of this activation group for organic catalysis or Friedel−Crafts alkylations.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252003","docid":252003,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255915","fileid":1255915,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252003,"filename":"ja0767480.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"851573c54d9cd274e59d8c1a9ccdae17","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":85998,"mtime":"2017-05-10 15:26:08","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77329/1/ja0767480.pdf"}],"eprintid":77329,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"ja0767480.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252004","docid":252004,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255919","fileid":1255919,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252004,"filename":"ja0767480-file001.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"31d19debfc405c4213591989dc4b930a","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":14165871,"mtime":"2017-05-10 15:28:21","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77329/2/ja0767480-file001.pdf"}],"eprintid":77329,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"ja0767480-file001.pdf","content":"supplemental"}],"note":"© 2007 American Chemical Society. \n\nReceived September 6, 2007.
