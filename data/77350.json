{"title":"Stability of singular spectral types under decaying perturbations","uri":"","abstract":"We look at invariance of a.e. boundary condition spectral behavior under perturbations, W, of half-line, continuum or discrete Schrödinger operators. We extend the results of del Rio, Simon, Stolz from compactly supported W's to suitable short-range W. We also discuss invariance of the local Hausdorff dimension of spectral measures under such perturbations.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252033","docid":252033,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256091","fileid":1256091,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252033,"filename":"1-s2.0-S0022123602000538-main.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"832e37d099a84ff012324e03ba8b39a3","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":248785,"mtime":"2017-05-10 20:50:00","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77350/1/1-s2.0-S0022123602000538-main.pdf"}],"eprintid":77350,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"1-s2.0-S0022123602000538-main.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252034","docid":252034,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256093","fileid":1256093,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252034,"filename":"0110139.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"f7fcd1a69e1908590611392b589302e8","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":256166,"mtime":"2017-05-10 20:50:06","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77350/2/0110139.pdf"}],"eprintid":77350,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0110139.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2002 Elsevier Science. \n\nReceived 15 October 2001, Revised 27 June 2002, Accepted 3 July 2002, Available online 7 January 2003. \n\nSupported in part by NSF Grant DMS-0102554 and by an Alfred P.
