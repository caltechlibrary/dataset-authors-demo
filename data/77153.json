{"title":"Nickel-catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross-couplings with vinyl bromide electrophiles","uri":"","abstract":"Nickel-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling reactions allow for the use of bench-stable electrophiles as both\ncross-coupling partners. In an effort to broaden the range of viable substrates in asym. transformations, two \nnew cross-coupling reactions using vinyl bromide electrophiles were developed. The cross-coupling of \nvinyl bromides with chlorobenzyl silanes in the presence of a chiral nickel bis(oxazoline) catalyst and \nstoichiometric manganese reductant delivers chiral allyl silane products with excellent enantioselectivity. These \nproducts are known to participate in diastereoselective allylation reactions that form addnl. stereocenters, \nbuilding mol. complexity. Application of the same catalyst-ligand system to the cross-coupling of vinyl\nbromides with N-hydroxyphthalimide esters gives rise to chiral allylic stereocenters in the presence of\ntetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene as a terminal org. reductant.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251655","docid":251655,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252872","fileid":1252872,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251655,"filename":"Hofstra_2017pORGN-222.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"edd3c4f68f506316b0f2b8e933124d88","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":89643,"mtime":"2017-05-03 17:48:54","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77153/1/Hofstra_2017pORGN-222.pdf"}],"eprintid":77153,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Hofstra_2017pORGN-222.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77153,"rev_number":9,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/53","datestamp":"2017-05-03 18:08:18","lastmod":"2017-05-03 18:08:18","status_changed":"2017-05-03 18:08:18","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Julie","family":"Hofstra","id":"Hofstra-J-L","orcid":""},{"given":"Naoyuki","family":"Suzuki","id":"Suzuki-Naoyuki","orcid":""},{"given":"Kelsey","family":"Poremba","id":"Poremba-K-E","orcid":"0000-0002-7446-257X"},{"given":"Sarah E.","family":"Reisman","id":"Reisman-S-E","orcid":"0000-0001-8244-9300"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"ORGN-222","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-104847932","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170503-104847932","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
