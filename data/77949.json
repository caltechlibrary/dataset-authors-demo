{"title":"Structural, Electrochemical, and Photophysical Properties of Gallium(III) 5,10,15-Tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole","uri":"","abstract":"High quantum yields are found for the prototype metallocorrole 1, which is readily prepared from GaCl_3 and tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole. The crystallographic and electronic structures of 1 are reported as well as the simple generation of its π-cation radical complex by chemical oxidation and the characteristic spectroscopic features of this ion.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253230","docid":253230,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1266942","fileid":1266942,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253230,"filename":"f5205f30e6ebc7ed37dbf97b56e466f4cb0a0aa77c32824e470acd35f6ebdd00.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"91ae96fdbe3ae0dfaaf5f7232f9361f6","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":116699,"mtime":"2017-06-05 22:49:15","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77949/1/f5205f30e6ebc7ed37dbf97b56e466f4cb0a0aa77c32824e470acd35f6ebdd00.pdf"}],"eprintid":77949,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"f5205f30e6ebc7ed37dbf97b56e466f4cb0a0aa77c32824e470acd35f6ebdd00.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2000 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, Weinheim, Fed.
