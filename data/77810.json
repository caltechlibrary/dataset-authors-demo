{"title":"On ground states for the L^2-critical boson star equation","uri":"","abstract":"We consider ground state solutions u ⩾ 0 for the L^2-critical boson star equation √−u − (|x|^(−1) ∗ |u|^2)u = −u in R^3. We prove analyticity and radial symmetry of u.\nIn a previous version of this paper, we also stated uniqueness and nondegeneracy of ground states for the L^2-critical boson star equation in R^3, but the arguments given there contained a gap. However, we refer to our recent preprint [FraLe] in arXiv:1009.4042, where we prove a general uniqueness and nondegeneracy result for ground states of nonlinear equations with fractional Laplacians in d = 1 space dimension.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252836","docid":252836,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263851","fileid":1263851,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252836,"filename":"0910.2721.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"839a7e1575edd71b9f660d243e726f92","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":252548,"mtime":"2017-05-26 17:19:24","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77810/1/0910.2721.pdf"}],"eprintid":77810,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0910.2721.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2010 by the authors.
