{"title":"Tweet, for science!: A social media course for scientists at Caltech tackling inreach and outreach online","uri":"","abstract":"The public places greater trust in scientists than in conventional media outlets for communicating science, and yet STEM topics are among the least represented areas on social media platforms. As technol. evolves, so do tools for online communication. Hence it is imperative that\nscientists develop and implement skills to use social media effectively. In Social Media for Scientists at the California Institute of Technol., students are introduced to how social media and science intersect and learn how to use social media for both inreach (engaging each other)\nand outreach (engaging general audiences). In the course, co-taught by a Chem. Engineering professor (Mark E. Davis) and a communications professional (Sarah Mojarad), students explore ethics, misinformation management, branding, and law through case studies, discussion boards, and various social media projects.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251818","docid":251818,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1254383","fileid":1254383,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251818,"filename":"Wilkins_2017pCHED-159.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"be2b5fcb1d32a833fb042f66920f121f","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":243058,"mtime":"2017-05-05 19:49:46","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77227/1/Wilkins_2017pCHED-159.pdf"}],"eprintid":77227,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"Wilkins_2017pCHED-159.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 American Chemical Society.","id":77227,"rev_number":11,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/72/27","datestamp":"2017-05-05 20:01:13","lastmod":"2017-05-05 20:01:13","status_changed":"2017-05-05 20:01:13","type":"conference_item","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Olivia","family":"Wilkins","id":"Wilkins-O","orcid":""},{"given":"Mark E.","family":"Davis","id":"Davis-M-E","orcid":""},{"given":"Sarah","family":"Mojarad","id":"Mojarad-S","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"CHED-159","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170505-124940271","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170505-124940271","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html","type":"org","description":"Conference Website"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
