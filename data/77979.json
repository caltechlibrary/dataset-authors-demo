{"title":"Nonuniform decimation and reconstruction of generalized-bandlimited MD signals","uri":"","abstract":"It is well known that the data rate of bandlimited signals can be reduced without loss of information. One scheme which achieves this goal  is the so-called nonuniform decimation. Recent  results show that a bandlimited signal can be reconstructed from a  nonuniformly decimated version. Theoretical results and efficient reconstruction methods have been addressed for one-dimensional signals. For the multidimensional case, some partial results are known. In this paper, we will discuss in detail the theory and implementation of the reconstruction of generalized-bandlimited multidimensional signals from their nonuniformly decimated versions.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253292","docid":253292,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1267484","fileid":1267484,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253292,"filename":"00393672.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"d5fd56ec2722ff7f6583b241e4ef1aaa","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":348537,"mtime":"2017-06-06 23:03:37","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77979/1/00393672.pdf"}],"eprintid":77979,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00393672.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 1993 IEEE. \n\nWork supported in  parts by the NSF grant MIP 8919196, and by matching  funds from Tektronix, Inc., and Rockwell International.","id":77979,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/79/79","datestamp":"2017-06-07 16:30:59","lastmod":"2017-06-07 16:30:59","status_changed":"2017-06-07 16:30:59","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Tsuhan","family":"Chen","id":"Chen-Tsuhan","orcid":""},{"given":"P.
