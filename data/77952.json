{"title":"Fluorinated hydrocarbons as MRI contrast agents","uri":"","abstract":"MRI contrast agents have been widely used to enhance tumor \ndetection and improve tumor image quality. Particulate MRI contrast agents using conventional proton magnetic resonance imaging have met with limited success. Herein, we report a process to microencapsulate fluorinated hydrocarbons in a biocompatible protein shell and their efficacy as contrast agents for fluorine magnetic resonance imaging (^(19)F MRI).
