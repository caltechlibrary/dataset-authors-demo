{"title":"Efficient Multiphoton Generation in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics","uri":"","abstract":"Engineering quantum states of light is at the basis of many quantum technologies such as quantum cryptography, teleportation, or metrology among others. Though, single photons can be generated in many scenarios, the efficient and reliable generation of complex single-mode multiphoton states is still a long-standing goal in the field, as current methods either suffer from low fidelities or small probabilities. Here we discuss several protocols which harness the strong and long-range atomic interactions induced by waveguide QED to efficiently load excitations in a collection of atoms, which can then be triggered to produce the desired multiphoton state. In order to boost the success probability and fidelity of each excitation process, atoms are used to both generate the excitations in the rest, as well as to herald the successful generation. Furthermore, to overcome the exponential scaling of the probability of success with the number of excitations, we design a protocol to merge excitations that are present in different internal atomic levels with a polynomial scaling.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252669","docid":252669,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1262340","fileid":1262340,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252669,"filename":"PhysRevLett.118.213601.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"450ce7abb15bf889d881ed3246365b07","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":463976,"mtime":"2017-05-24 16:14:40","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77697/1/PhysRevLett.118.213601.pdf"}],"eprintid":77697,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"PhysRevLett.118.213601.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252670","docid":252670,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1262347","fileid":1262347,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252670,"filename":"PSdraftv25SMshort.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"f4fa83ab96456ca671ac6e46e24055bd","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1758515,"mtime":"2017-05-24 16:17:11","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77697/2/PSdraftv25SMshort.pdf"}],"eprintid":77697,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"PSdraftv25SMshort.pdf","content":"supplemental"}],"note":"© 2017 American Physical Society.\n\nReceived 2 November 2016; published 24 May 2017.\n\nThe work of A. G.-T, V. P., and J. I. C. was funded by the European Union integrated project Simulators and Interfaces with Quantum Systems (SIQS).
