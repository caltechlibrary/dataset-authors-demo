{"title":"Weakly coupled bound states of Pauli operators","uri":"","abstract":"We consider the two-dimensional Pauli operator perturbed by a weakly coupled, attractive potential. We show that besides the eigenvalues arising from the Aharonov-Casher zero modes there are two or one (depending on whether the flux of the magnetic field is integer or not) additional eigenvalues for arbitrarily small coupling and we calculate their asymptotics in the weak coupling limit.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252828","docid":252828,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263787","fileid":1263787,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252828,"filename":"0903.5333.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"c6eb01488ee3384188e4d323302e2b1f","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":268740,"mtime":"2017-05-26 16:49:32","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77804/1/0903.5333.pdf"}],"eprintid":77804,"pos":1,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0903.5333.pdf","content":"submitted"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252837","docid":252837,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263873","fileid":1263873,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252837,"filename":"art%3A10.1007%2Fs00526-010-0339-x.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"9beb716a0d0d1f2d95e92283ea547918","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":269347,"mtime":"2017-05-26 17:33:58","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77804/2/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00526-010-0339-x.pdf"}],"eprintid":77804,"pos":2,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"art%3A10.1007%2Fs00526-010-0339-x.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2010 by the authors.
