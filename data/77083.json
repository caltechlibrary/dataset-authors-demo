{"title":"Uniqueness and Nondegeneracy of Ground States for (−Δ)^sQ+Q−Q^(α+1)=0 in R","uri":"","abstract":"We prove uniqueness of ground state solutions Q = Q(|x|)≥0 for the nonlinear equation (−Δ)^sQ + Q − Q^(α+)1 = 0 in R, where 0 \u003c s \u003c 1 and 0 \u003c α \u003c _(4s) ^(1−2s) for s \u003c 1/2 and 0 \u003c α \u003c ∞ for s ≥ 1/2. Here (−Δ)^s denotes the fractional Laplacian in one dimension. In particular, we generalize (by completely different techniques) the specific uniqueness result obtained by Amick and Toland for s = 1/2 and α = 1 in [Acta Math.,167 (1991), 107-126]. As a technical key result in this paper, we show that the associated linearized operator L_+ = (−Δ)^s + 1− (α+1)Q^α is nondegenerate; i.,e., its kernel satisfies ker L_+ = span {Q′}. This result about L_+ proves a spectral assumption, which plays a central role for the stability of solitary waves and blowup analysis for nonlinear dispersive PDEs with fractional Laplacians, such as the generalized Benjamin-Ono (BO) and Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) water wave equations.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251510","docid":251510,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1251260","fileid":1251260,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251510,"filename":"1009.4042.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"09727212ab7d8968545d2be28c405222","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":558803,"mtime":"2017-05-01 14:28:16","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77083/1/1009.4042.pdf"}],"eprintid":77083,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1009.4042.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"(Submitted on 21 Sep 2010 (v1), last revised 23 Mar 2015 (this version, v2)) \n\n\nR.
