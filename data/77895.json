{"title":"Magnetic regulator modeling","uri":"","abstract":"A method of providing regulation in a resonant power supply uses a device called a magnetic regulator which resembles an ordinary AC transformer. Through the use of additional control windings, the conversion ratio of the magnetic regulator can be electronically varied, thus achieving control. A circuit model for the magnetic regulator is derived and is shown to contain a current-controlled leakage inductance. Measurements made on an experimental device verify the model. Two additional structures are described.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253015","docid":253015,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265409","fileid":1265409,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253015,"filename":"00290727.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"cf5640bb378a0b099f95181d48ac90c0","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":610077,"mtime":"2017-06-01 21:14:44","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77895/1/00290727.pdf"}],"eprintid":77895,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00290727.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 1993 IEEE. \n\nThis work was sponsored by Hughes Missile Systems Group, \nCanoga Park, CA.","id":77895,"rev_number":9,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/78/95","datestamp":"2017-06-01 23:19:29","lastmod":"2017-06-02 02:32:01","status_changed":"2017-06-01 23:19:29","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Jeff","family":"Vollin","id":"Vollin-J-L","orcid":""},{"given":"F.
