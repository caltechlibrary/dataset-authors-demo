{"title":"Persistence of Invariant Sets for Dissipative Evolution Equations","uri":"","abstract":"We show that results concerning the persistence of invariant sets of ordinary differential equations under perturbation may be applied directly to a certain class of partial differential equations. Our framework is particularly well-suited to encompass numerical approximations of these partial differential equations. Specifically, we show that for a class of PDEs with aC^1 inertial form, certain natural numerical approximations possess an inertial form close to that of the underlying PDE in theC^1 norm.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253439","docid":253439,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1268488","fileid":1268488,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253439,"filename":"1-s2.0-S0022247X97958479-main.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"7214c47b98992a54ce4e22565a85c950","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":195911,"mtime":"2017-06-09 19:33:23","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/78058/1/1-s2.0-S0022247X97958479-main.pdf"}],"eprintid":78058,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"1-s2.0-S0022247X97958479-main.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 1998 Academic Press. \n\nReceived 9 December 1996. \n\nWe thank Steve Shkoller and Tony Shardlow for their careful reading of the manuscript and for their helpful suggestions.
