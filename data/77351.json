{"title":"Resonances in One Dimension and Fredholm Determinants","uri":"","abstract":"We discuss resonances for Schrödinger operators in whole- and half-line problems. One of our goals is to connect the Fredholm determinant approach of Froese to the Fourier transform approach of Zworski. Another is to prove a result on the number of antibound states—namely, in a half-line problem there are an odd number of antibound states between any two bound states.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252035","docid":252035,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256106","fileid":1256106,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252035,"filename":"1-s2.0-S0022123600936693-main.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"19609e0849487adc56ca77fed9713069","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":170217,"mtime":"2017-05-10 21:05:10","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77351/1/1-s2.0-S0022123600936693-main.pdf"}],"eprintid":77351,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"1-s2.0-S0022123600936693-main.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2000 Academic Press. \n\nReceived 5 June 2000, Accepted 8 August 2000, Available online 26 March 2002. \n\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant DMS-9707661.
