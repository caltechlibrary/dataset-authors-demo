{"title":"Shortening Array Codes and the Perfect 1-Factorization Conjecture","uri":"","abstract":"The existence of a perfect 1-factorization of the complete graph K n, for arbitrary n, is a 40-year old open problem in graph theory. Two infinite families of perfect 1-factorizations are known for K_(2p) and K_(p+1), where p is a prime. It was shown in L. Xu et al. (1999) that finding a perfect 1-factorization of K_n can be reduced to a problem in coding, i.e. to constructing an MDS, lowest density array code of length n. In this paper, a new method for shortening arbitrary array codes is introduced. It is then used to derive the K_(p+1) family of perfect 1-factorizations from the K_(2p) family, by applying the reduction mentioned above. Namely, techniques from coding theory are used to prove a new result in graph theory.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252323","docid":252323,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1258405","fileid":1258405,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252323,"filename":"04036483.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"a39cf94b085a692aa88a5370beef6525","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":206602,"mtime":"2017-05-16 22:11:10","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77506/1/04036483.pdf"}],"eprintid":77506,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04036483.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE.","id":77506,"rev_number":10,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/75/06","datestamp":"2017-05-16 22:20:08","lastmod":"2017-05-16 22:20:08","status_changed":"2017-05-16 22:20:08","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Vasken","family":"Bohossian","id":"Bohossian-V","orcid":""},{"given":"Jehoshua","family":"Bruck","id":"Bruck-J","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-07","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"2799-2803","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170516-150511939","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170516-150511939","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261572","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4036483/","type":"pub","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechPARADISE:2006.ETR075","type":"related","description":"Technical Report"}],"referencetext":["[1] M.
