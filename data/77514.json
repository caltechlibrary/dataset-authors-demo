{"title":"Optofluidic Distributed Feedback Dye Laser","uri":"","abstract":"We demonstrated an optofluidic distributed feedback (DFB) dye laser on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) chip. Single-mode operation was obtained with 0.21nm linewidth. We achieved nearly 60nm continuously tunable output by mechanically varying the grating period.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252341","docid":252341,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1258584","fileid":1258584,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252341,"filename":"04627620.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"e1f86097fca395bed47e01c2836dd8f6","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":341466,"mtime":"2017-05-17 00:37:48","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77514/1/04627620.pdf"}],"eprintid":77514,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04627620.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2006 Optical Society of America. \n\nThis research was supported by the DARPA center for optofluidic integration.","id":77514,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/75/14","datestamp":"2017-05-17 16:11:16","lastmod":"2017-05-17 16:11:16","status_changed":"2017-05-17 16:11:16","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Zhenyu","family":"Li","id":"Li-Zhenyu","orcid":""},{"given":"Zhaoyu","family":"Zhang","id":"Zhang-Zhaoyu","orcid":""},{"given":"Teresa","family":"Emery","id":"Emery-T","orcid":""},{"given":"Axel","family":"Scherer","id":"Scherer-A","orcid":""},{"given":"Demetri","family":"Psaltis","id":"Psaltis-D","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-05","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"paper CFJ1","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170516-173316832","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170516-173316832","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=cleo-2006-CFJ1","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"Z.
