{"title":"A qualitative test for N-finger force-closure grasps on planar objects with applications to manipulation and finger gaits","uri":"","abstract":"This paper presents a force-closure test function for an n-finger grasp on a planar  object  with friction. All n-finger grasps can be  represented by an n-dimensional contact space. The critical conditions of the test function are used to define force-closure  curves which are the boundaries of force-closure sets in the contact configuration space. We show that the force  closure sets can be  decomposed into subsets in which m (m \u003c n) fingers \nsatisfy force closure. We also prove that m = 6 is an \nupper bound on the order of the force closure subsets. These subsets are required for planning finger gait maneuvers which are force-closure in all phases of the gait. The characteristics of these subsets are discussed, and an algorithm to enumerate them is given. The application of the  test function and the contact configuration  space formulation to multifinger  object manipulation and finger gait planning is demonstrated by an example.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252973","docid":252973,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1265120","fileid":1265120,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252973,"filename":"00291934.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"610c86e99d4716daab2525617479c428","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":675522,"mtime":"2017-06-01 00:33:34","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77871/1/00291934.pdf"}],"eprintid":77871,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00291934.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 1993 IEEE. \n\nThis work and the preparation of this report was supported by a Caltech President's Fund grant and  an NSF Young Investigator Award MSS-9157843.
