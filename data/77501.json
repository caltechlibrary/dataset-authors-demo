{"title":"Ruthenium Metallacycles Derived from 14-Electron Complexes. New Insights into Olefin Metathesis Intermediates","uri":"","abstract":"Ruthenium(IV) metallacycles derived from both ethylene and propene are reported. The propene-derived metallacycles represent the first observed examples of substituted ruthenacyclobutanes and offer new insight into the preferred stereochemical orientation about metathesis intermediates. In addition, a metallacycle possessing an unsymmetrical N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand was prepared and investigated to ascertain the dynamics of the NHC relative to the metallacycle ring. Metallacycles investigated were found to possess exchange cross-peaks between the α- and β-positions in the 2D NMR, indicating a dynamic structure. The implications of these results to the mechanism of ruthenium-catalyzed olefin metathesis are discussed.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252315","docid":252315,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1258332","fileid":1258332,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252315,"filename":"ja0666598.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"ff514259402aa3731fa3d68491b8d28f","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":51789,"mtime":"2017-05-16 21:34:38","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77501/1/ja0666598.pdf"}],"eprintid":77501,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"ja0666598.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252317","docid":252317,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1258340","fileid":1258340,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252317,"filename":"ja0666598si20061110_100650.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"bae5b1fa3a0ddd15756ca8315237535e","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1534473,"mtime":"2017-05-16 21:42:38","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77501/3/ja0666598si20061110_100650.pdf"}],"eprintid":77501,"pos":3,"placement":3,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"ja0666598si20061110_100650.pdf","content":"supplemental"}],"note":"© 2006 American Chemical Society. \n\nReceived 14 September 2006.
