{"title":"Extraction and Measurement of NAD(P)+ and NAD(P)H","uri":"","abstract":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides are critical redox-active substrates for countless catabolic and anabolic reactions. Ratios of NAD+ to NADH and NADP+ to NADPH are therefore considered key indicators of the overall intracellular redox potential and metabolic state. These ratios can be measured in bulk conditions using a highly sensitive enzyme cycling-based colorimetric assay (detection limit at or below 0.05 μM or 1 pmol) following a simple extraction procedure involving solutions of acid and base. Special considerations are necessary to avoid measurement artifacts caused by the presence of endogenous redox-active metabolites, such as phenazines made by diverse Pseudomonas species (see Chapter 25).","documents":null,"note":"Ⓒ 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","id":77593,"rev_number":6,"userid":5227,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/75/93","datestamp":"2017-05-19 15:03:00","lastmod":"2017-05-19 15:03:00","status_changed":"2017-05-19 15:03:00","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Suzanne E.","family":"Kern","id":"Kern-S-E","orcid":""},{"given":"Alexa","family":"Price-Whelan","id":"Price-Whelan-A","orcid":""},{"given":"Dianne K.","family":"Newman","id":"Newman-D-K","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2014-06-04","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"1149","pagerange":"311-323","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170518-165224584","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170518-165224584","related_url":[{"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-0473-0_26","type":"doi","description":"Book Chapter"},{"url":"http://www.springerprotocols.com/Abstract/doi/10.1007/978-1-4939-0473-0_26","type":"pub","description":"Book Chapter"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
