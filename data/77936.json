{"title":"Tunable excitation spectrum in quantum double models","uri":"","abstract":"Kitaev's quantum double models, including the toric code, are canonical examples of quantum topological models on a 2D spin lattice. Their Hamiltonian define the groundspace by imposing an energy penalty to any nontrivial flux or charge, but treats any such violation in the same way. Thus, their energy spectrum is very simple. We introduce a new family of quantum double Hamiltonians with adjustable coupling constants that allow us to tune the energy of anyons while conserving the same groundspace as Kitaev's original construction. Those Hamiltonians are made of commuting four-body projectors that provide an intricate splitting of the Hilbert space.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/253144","docid":253144,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1266538","fileid":1266538,"datasetid":"document","objectid":253144,"filename":"1701.04456.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"32f27854209fc91ab1225ba4e22330df","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":5074789,"mtime":"2017-06-05 15:35:58","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77936/1/1701.04456.pdf"}],"eprintid":77936,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1701.04456.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"We thank John Preskill, Alexei Kitaev, David Aasen, Ben Levitan and Sujeet Shukla for helpful discussions.
