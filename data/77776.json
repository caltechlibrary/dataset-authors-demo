{"title":"Special angle cut of potassium niobate crystal for thermal fixing","uri":"","abstract":"We investigated the optimal cut of potassium niobate crystals to approach the maximum exponential photorefractive gain coefficient and the highest diffraction efficiency. Volume hologram is thermally fixed in this sample and a significant enhancement of diffraction efficiency is achieved.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252797","docid":252797,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263562","fileid":1263562,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252797,"filename":"00602333.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"43d0205c9fc186008a050545b55a476b","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":332575,"mtime":"2017-05-25 23:07:49","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77776/1/00602333.pdf"}],"eprintid":77776,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00602333.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 1997 Optical Society of America.","id":77776,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/77/76","datestamp":"2017-05-26 17:37:09","lastmod":"2017-05-26 17:37:09","status_changed":"2017-05-26 17:37:09","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Xiaolin","family":"Tong","id":"Tong-Xiaolin","orcid":""},{"given":"Amnon","family":"Yariv","id":"Yariv-A","orcid":""},{"given":"Aharon","family":"Agranat","id":"Agranat-A","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"1997-05","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"paper CTuP12","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170525-160212415","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170525-160212415","related_url":[{"url":"https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=cleo-1997-CTuP12","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["1. \nY. \nFainman, \nE. \nKlancnik, \nS. \nH. \nLee, \nOpt. \nEng. \n25,228 \n(1986). \n2. \nP. \nGunter, \nPhys.
