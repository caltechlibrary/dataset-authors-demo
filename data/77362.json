{"title":"The sharp constant in the Hardy-Sobolev-Maz’ya inequality in the three dimensional upper half-space","uri":"","abstract":"It is shown that the sharp constant in the Hardy-Sobolev-Maz’ya inequality on the upper half space H^3 ⊂ R^3 is given by the Sobolev constant. This is achieved by a duality argument relating the problem to a Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev type inequality whose sharp constant is determined as well.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252049","docid":252049,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256234","fileid":1256234,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252049,"filename":"0705.3833.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"bacb2329f558196f8955887285af879e","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":129789,"mtime":"2017-05-11 13:49:31","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77362/1/0705.3833.pdf"}],"eprintid":77362,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"0705.3833.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2007 by the authors.
