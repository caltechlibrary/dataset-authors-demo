{"title":"Approximate Reduction of Dynamical Systems","uri":"","abstract":"The reduction of dynamical systems has a rich history, with many important applications related to stability, control and verification. Reduction is typically performed in an \"exact\" manner - as is the case with mechanical systems with symmetry - which, unfortunately, limits the type of systems to which it can be applied. The goal of this paper is to consider a more general form of reduction, termed approximate reduction, in order to extend the class of systems that can be reduced. Using notions related to incremental stability, we give conditions on when a dynamical system can be projected to a lower dimensional space while providing hard bounds on the induced errors, i.e., when it is behaviorally similar to a dynamical system on a lower dimensional space. These concepts are illustrated on a series of examples.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252047","docid":252047,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256223","fileid":1256223,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252047,"filename":"04177710.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"9829e0cefd4e475b91ebd18f044147ec","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":217001,"mtime":"2017-05-11 00:47:26","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77361/1/04177710.pdf"}],"eprintid":77361,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04177710.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE. \n\nThis research was partially supported by the National Science Foundation, EHS award 0509313 and CCR award 0225610.","id":77361,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/73/61","datestamp":"2017-05-16 19:47:30","lastmod":"2017-05-16 19:47:30","status_changed":"2017-05-16 19:47:30","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Paulo","family":"Tabuada","id":"Tabuada-P","orcid":""},{"given":"Aaron D.","family":"Ames","id":"Ames-A-D","orcid":""},{"given":"Agung","family":"Julius","id":"Julius-A","orcid":""},{"given":"George","family":"Pappas","id":"Pappas-G","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-12","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"6408-6413","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170510-174336817","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170510-174336817","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2006.377156","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4177710/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["AMR88]   R.
