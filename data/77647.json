{"title":"Localized water reverberation phases and its impact on back-projection images","uri":"","abstract":"Coherent radiators imaged by back-projections (BP) are commonly interpreted as part of the rupture process. Nevertheless, artifacts introduced by structure related phases are rarely discriminated from the rupture process. In this study, we use a calibration event to discriminate between rupture and structure effects. We re-examine the waveforms and BP images of the 2012 M_w 7.2 Indian Ocean earthquake and a calibration event (M_w 6.2). The P wave codas of both events present similar shape with characteristic period of approximately 10 s, which are back-projected as coherent radiators near the trench. S wave BP doesn't image energy radiation near the trench. We interpret those coda waves as localized water reverberation phases excited near the trench. We perform a 2D waveform modeling using realistic bathymetry model, and find that the steep near-trench bathymetry traps the acoustic water waves forming localized reverberation phases. These waves can be imaged as coherent near-trench radiators with similar features as that in the observations. We present a set of methodologies to discriminate between the rupture and propagation effects in BP images, which can serve as a criterion of subevent identification.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252580","docid":252580,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261650","fileid":1261650,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252580,"filename":"Yue_et_al-2017-Geophysical_Research_Letters.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"3e697606c08eb6761a36b96c5d59d79e","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1063853,"mtime":"2017-05-23 15:21:22","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77647/1/Yue_et_al-2017-Geophysical_Research_Letters.pdf"}],"eprintid":77647,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"Yue_et_al-2017-Geophysical_Research_Letters.pdf","content":"accepted"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252581","docid":252581,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261656","fileid":1261656,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252581,"filename":"grl55981-sup-0001-2017GL073254_SI.docx","mime_type":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","hash":"df4c758ed70aae6589af8e2de6d81901","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":5560586,"mtime":"2017-05-23 15:24:28","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77647/2/grl55981-sup-0001-2017GL073254_SI.docx"}],"eprintid":77647,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","format":"application/msword","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"grl55981-sup-0001-2017GL073254_SI.docx","content":"supplemental"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252582","docid":252582,"rev_number":1,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261658","fileid":1261658,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252582,"filename":"indexcodes.txt","mime_type":"text/x-pascal","hash":"1b2f629605170824b1525f0b9da25c4d","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":4056,"mtime":"2017-05-23 15:24:50","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77647/3/indexcodes.txt"}],"eprintid":77647,"pos":3,"placement":3,"mime_type":"text/x-pascal","format":"other","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"indexcodes.txt","content":""},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252583","docid":252583,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261659","fileid":1261659,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252583,"filename":"grl55981-sup-0002-2017GL073254_ms01.avi","mime_type":"video/x-msvideo","hash":"8bf42b55543c53577a6707881fd72459","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":7189046,"mtime":"2017-05-23 15:25:11","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77647/4/grl55981-sup-0002-2017GL073254_ms01.avi"}],"eprintid":77647,"pos":4,"placement":4,"mime_type":"video/x-msvideo","format":"video/x-msvideo","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"grl55981-sup-0002-2017GL073254_ms01.avi","content":"supplemental"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252584","docid":252584,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261661","fileid":1261661,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252584,"filename":"grl55981-sup-0003-2017GL073254_ms02.avi","mime_type":"video/x-msvideo","hash":"db3fdd1b970e9e8f5a9667ec3436bd6d","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":6113284,"mtime":"2017-05-23 15:25:30","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77647/5/grl55981-sup-0003-2017GL073254_ms02.avi"}],"eprintid":77647,"pos":5,"placement":5,"mime_type":"video/x-msvideo","format":"video/x-msvideo","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"grl55981-sup-0003-2017GL073254_ms02.avi","content":"supplemental"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252585","docid":252585,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261663","fileid":1261663,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252585,"filename":"grl55981-sup-0004-2017GL073254_ms03.mov","mime_type":"video/quicktime","hash":"7fac2f32d3d16b99bce53014151c237d","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":23344342,"mtime":"2017-05-23 15:25:43","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77647/6/grl55981-sup-0004-2017GL073254_ms03.mov"}],"eprintid":77647,"pos":6,"placement":6,"mime_type":"video/quicktime","format":"video/quicktime","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"grl55981-sup-0004-2017GL073254_ms03.mov","content":"supplemental"}],"note":"© 2017 American Geophysical Union. \n\nAccepted manuscript online: 22 May 2017; Manuscript Accepted: 17 May 2017; Manuscript Revised: 15 May 2017; Manuscript Received: 25 February 2017. \n\nData analysis and plotting made use of GMT and Matlab.
