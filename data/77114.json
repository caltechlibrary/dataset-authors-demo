{"title":"Distributed Fault Diagnosis using Sensor Networks and Consensus-based Filters","uri":"","abstract":"This paper considers the problem of designing distributed fault diagnosis algorithms for dynamic systems using sensor networks. A network of distributed estimation agents is designed where a bank of local Kalman filters is embedded into each sensor. The diagnosis decision is performed by a distributed hypothesis testing method that relies on a belief consensus algorithm. Under certain assumptions, both the distributed estimation and the diagnosis algorithms are derived from their centralized counterparts thanks to dynamic average-consensus techniques. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and algorithm.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251622","docid":251622,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1252589","fileid":1252589,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251622,"filename":"04177940.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"bea892588d185b123d2a75620937c44b","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":257113,"mtime":"2017-05-02 23:44:59","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77114/1/04177940.pdf"}],"eprintid":77114,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"04177940.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2006 IEEE. \n\nThis  work  has  been  partially supported by the Italian Ministry for University and Research.","id":77114,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/71/14","datestamp":"2017-05-03 18:20:43","lastmod":"2017-05-03 18:20:43","status_changed":"2017-05-03 18:20:43","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Elisa","family":"Franco","id":"Franco-E","orcid":""},{"given":"Reza","family":"Olfati-Saber","id":"Olfati-Saber-R","orcid":""},{"given":"Thomas","family":"Parisini","id":"Parisini-T","orcid":""},{"given":"Marios M.","family":"Polycarpou","id":"Polycarpou-M-M","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2006-12","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"386-391","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170501-174658779","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170501-174658779","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2006.376797","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4177940/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[1]  E.
