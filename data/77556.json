{"title":"Fears and Facts About Electoral Integrity","uri":"","abstract":"This paper puts the issues of election integrity that arose in 2016 in context. First, I identify four integrity-related themes that have arisen in American elections since the 2000 presidential election. Second, I examine what it means to assess the health of the American electoral system. Third, I provide two frameworks for assessing the health of the election system, one that takes the perspective of a typical voter, the other that focuses on the flow of information in an election. I conclude by bringing this discussion back to the specific case of 2016, providing a preliminary assessment of the health of the election process in the most recent federal election.","documents":null,"note":"Â© 2017 National Endowment for Democracy and John Hopkins University Press.","id":77556,"rev_number":5,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/75/56","datestamp":"2017-05-18 16:12:39","lastmod":"2017-05-18 16:12:39","status_changed":"2017-05-18 16:12:39","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Charles, III","family":"Stewart","id":"Stewart-C-III","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"Journal of Democracy","volume":"28","number":"2","pagerange":"50-62","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170518-085641990","refereed":true,"issn":"1086-3214","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170518-085641990","related_url":[{"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jod.2017.0024","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/653376","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"GP","local_group":null}
