It focuses on political violence in the later Middle Ages, and in particular on violence both by and against rulers. Geographically it covers continental Europe, with side trips to England and Scotland. Nevertheless, it devotes significant attention to the Islamic world.","documents":null,"note":"© 2016 The Author 2016.
