{"title":"A Rapid Capillary-Pressure Driven Micro-Channel to Demonstrate Newtonian Fluid Behavior of Zebrafish Blood at High Shear Rates","uri":"","abstract":"Blood viscosity provides the rheological basis to elucidate shear stress underlying developmental cardiac mechanics and physiology. Zebrafish is a high throughput model for developmental biology, forward-genetics, and drug discovery. The micro-scale posed an experimental challenge to measure blood viscosity. To address this challenge, a microfluidic viscometer driven by surface tension was developed to reduce the sample volume required (3μL) for rapid (\u003c2 min) and continuous viscosity measurement. By fitting the power-law fluid model to the travel distance of blood through the micro-channel as a function of time and channel configuration, the experimentally acquired blood viscosity was compared with a vacuum-driven capillary viscometer at high shear rates (\u003e500 s^(−1)), at which the power law exponent (n) of zebrafish blood was nearly 1 behaving as a Newtonian fluid. The measured values of whole blood from the micro-channel (4.17cP) and the vacuum method (4.22cP) at 500 s^(−1) were closely correlated at 27 °C. A calibration curve was established for viscosity as a function of hematocrits to predict a rise and fall in viscosity during embryonic development. Thus, our rapid capillary pressure-driven micro-channel revealed the Newtonian fluid behavior of zebrafish blood at high shear rates and the dynamic viscosity during development.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252559","docid":252559,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261316","fileid":1261316,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252559,"filename":"art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-017-02253-7.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"18e6149ecfe9a3267e3eda000fe4aa2a","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":2260135,"mtime":"2017-05-22 21:50:10","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77632/1/art%253A10.1038%252Fs41598-017-02253-7.pdf"}],"eprintid":77632,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-017-02253-7.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252560","docid":252560,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261322","fileid":1261322,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252560,"filename":"41598_2017_2253_MOESM1_ESM.avi","mime_type":"video/x-msvideo","hash":"666320cff5366f1b20aca968838c938d","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":83538126,"mtime":"2017-05-22 22:00:54","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77632/2/41598_2017_2253_MOESM1_ESM.avi"}],"eprintid":77632,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"video/x-msvideo","format":"video/x-msvideo","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"41598_2017_2253_MOESM1_ESM.avi","content":"supplemental"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252561","docid":252561,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261329","fileid":1261329,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252561,"filename":"41598_2017_2253_MOESM2_ESM.avi","mime_type":"video/x-msvideo","hash":"817fb0b2a99d1f898d4153f95329ad6e","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":48540384,"mtime":"2017-05-22 22:03:55","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77632/3/41598_2017_2253_MOESM2_ESM.avi"}],"eprintid":77632,"pos":3,"placement":3,"mime_type":"video/x-msvideo","format":"video/x-msvideo","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"41598_2017_2253_MOESM2_ESM.avi","content":"supplemental"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252562","docid":252562,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261331","fileid":1261331,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252562,"filename":"41598_2017_2253_MOESM3_ESM.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"e87d7d6836332adbf321704a2e02176a","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":268463,"mtime":"2017-05-22 22:04:13","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77632/4/41598_2017_2253_MOESM3_ESM.pdf"}],"eprintid":77632,"pos":4,"placement":4,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"cc_by","main":"41598_2017_2253_MOESM3_ESM.pdf","content":"supplemental"}],"note":"© 2017 The Author(s).
