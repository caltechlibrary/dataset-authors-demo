{"title":"Surface defects generated by extrinsic origins on 4H-SiC epitaxial-wafers observed by scanning electron microscopy","uri":"","abstract":"Surface defects on 4H-SiC wafers with an epitaxial layer grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Commercially available epitaxial-wafers with four or eight deg-off surface from the [0001] toward the  [1120] directions were used for this experiment. 3C-SiC particles, triangular-defects, comets, obtuse-triangular-shaped-defects and micro-holes were identified in the SEM images. This paper can be considered as a catalog of SEM images and descriptions of various surface defects for 4H-SiC wafers with a CVD-grown epilayer.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251434","docid":251434,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1250595","fileid":1250595,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251434,"filename":"dfw107.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"b11a4eeaa1107221501311c897eb0a06","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":575642,"mtime":"2017-04-28 15:03:01","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77040/1/dfw107.pdf"}],"eprintid":77040,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"dfw107.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© The Author 2016.
