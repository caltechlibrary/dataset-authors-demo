{"title":"Realization of the mapping class group by homeomorphisms","uri":"","abstract":"In this paper, we show that the mapping class group of a closed surface can not be geometrically realized as a group of homeomorphisms of that surface. More precisely, let Pr:Homeo(M)→MC(M)  denote the standard projection of the group of homeomorphisms to the mapping class group of a closed surface M of genus g\u003e5. We show that there is no homomorphism E:MC(M)→Homeo(M),  such that Pr∘E is the identity. This answers a question by Thurston (see [11]).","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251888","docid":251888,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255013","fileid":1255013,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251888,"filename":"art%3A10.1007%2Fs00222-007-0039-0.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"113638c93849c23cd58567db6666084c","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":533718,"mtime":"2017-05-08 16:22:53","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77251/1/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00222-007-0039-0.pdf"}],"eprintid":77251,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"art%3A10.1007%2Fs00222-007-0039-0.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252382","docid":252382,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1258887","fileid":1258887,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252382,"filename":"M-mcg.ps","mime_type":"application/postscript","hash":"f3c9009caa426da59ddb3d63eb285576","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":1281574,"mtime":"2017-05-17 19:48:43","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77251/2/M-mcg.ps"}],"eprintid":77251,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/postscript","format":"application/postscript","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"M-mcg.ps","content":"submitted"}],"note":"© 2007 Springer-Verlag.\n\nReceived: 01 July 2006; Accepted: 18 January 2007; First Online: 07 March 2007.\n\n\n\n","id":77251,"rev_number":11,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/72/51","datestamp":"2017-05-09 21:55:21","lastmod":"2017-05-17 19:48:43","status_changed":"2017-05-09 21:55:21","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Vladimir","family":"Markovic","id":"Markovic-V","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2007-06","date_type":"published","publication":"Inventiones Mathematicae","volume":"168","number":"3","pagerange":"523-566","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170508-092249054","refereed":true,"issn":"0020-9910","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170508-092249054","related_url":[{"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00222-007-0039-0","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00222-007-0039-0","type":"pub","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://rdcu.be/rYjP","type":"pub","description":"Free ReadCube access"}],"referencetext":["\n1.\n\nAhlfors, L., Sario, L.: Riemann Surfaces.
