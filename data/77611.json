{"title":"Detection of Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature in High Mass X-ray Binary Pulsar SMC X-2","uri":"","abstract":"We report broadband spectral properties of the high mass X-ray binary pulsar\nSMC X-2 by using three simultaneous $NuSTAR$ and $Swift$/XRT observations\nduring its 2015 outburst. The pulsar was significantly bright, reaching a\nluminosity up to as high as $\\sim$5.5$\\times$10$^{38}$~ergs~s$^{-1}$ in 1-70\nkeV range. Spin period of the pulsar was estimated to be 2.37 s. Pulse profiles\nwere found to be strongly luminosity dependent. The 1-70 keV energy spectrum of\nthe pulsar was well described with three different continuum models such as (i)\nnegative and positive power-law with exponential cutoff, (ii) Fermi-Dirac\ncutoff power-law and (iii) cutoff power-law models. Apart from the presence of\nan iron line at $\\sim$6.4 keV, a model independent absorption like feature at\n$\\sim$27 keV was detected in the pulsar spectrum. This feature was identified\nas a cyclotron absorption line and detected for the first time in this pulsar.\nCorresponding magnetic field of the neutron star was estimated to be\n$\\sim$2.3$\\times$10$^{12}$ G. The cyclotron line energy showed a marginal\nnegative dependence on the luminosity. The cyclotron line parameters were found\nto be variable with pulse phase and interpreted as due to the effect of\nemission geometry or complicated structure of the pulsar magnetic field.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252522","docid":252522,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1260861","fileid":1260861,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252522,"filename":"1705.05544.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"1de825ae3936e6fbca19ea8fb25710cb","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":453672,"mtime":"2017-05-20 23:15:41","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77611/1/1705.05544.pdf"}],"eprintid":77611,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"1705.05544.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"We sincerely thank the referee for his/her valuable comments and\nsuggestions which improved the paper.
