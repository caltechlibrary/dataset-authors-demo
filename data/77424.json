{"title":"Chlorination−Methylation of the Hydrogen-Terminated Silicon(111) Surface Can Induce a Stacking Fault in the Presence of Etch Pits","uri":"","abstract":"Recently, we reported STM images of the methylated Si(111) surface [prepared through chlorination−alkylation of the Si(111)−H surface] taken at 4.7 K, indicating that the torsion angle of the methyl group with respect to the subsurface silicon layer is φ = 23 ± 3°. Repulsions between H atoms in adjacent methyl groups are minimized at 30°, while repulsions between H atoms and second layer Si atoms are minimized at 60°. The experimental result of 23° is surprising because it suggests a tendency of the methyl group toward the eclipsed configuration (0°) rather than staggered (60°). In contrast, extensive fully periodic quantum mechanical Density Functional Theory studies of this surface give an equilibrium torsion angle of 37.5°, indicating a tendency toward the staggered configuration. This discrepancy can be resolved by showing that the CH_3 on the step edges and etch pits interacts repulsively with the CH_3 on the surface terraces unless a stacking fault is introduced between the first and second silicon layers of the Si(111)−CH_3 surface terraces. We propose that this could occur during the chlorination−alkylation of the Si(111)−H surface. This stacking fault model predicted φ = 22.5° measured with respect to the bulk (corresponding to φ = 37.5° with respect to the second layer Si atoms). This model can be tested by measuring the orientation of the CH_3 within the etch pits, which should have φ = 37.5°, or by making a surface without etch pits, which should have φ = 37.5°.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252147","docid":252147,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256877","fileid":1256877,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252147,"filename":"ja055408g.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"d640a717b58c87c06d92df663f317300","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":59438,"mtime":"2017-05-12 20:40:11","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77424/1/ja055408g.pdf"}],"eprintid":77424,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"ja055408g.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252148","docid":252148,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1256884","fileid":1256884,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252148,"filename":"ja055408gsi20060210_010750.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"b7f012984e127fc11d0c80f394e28e1a","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":297701,"mtime":"2017-05-12 20:48:31","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77424/2/ja055408gsi20060210_010750.pdf"}],"eprintid":77424,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"ja055408gsi20060210_010750.pdf","content":"supplemental"}],"note":"© 2006 American Chemical Society. \n\nReceived 15 August 2005.
