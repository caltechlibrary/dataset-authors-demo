{"title":"2-D photonic crystal microcavities","uri":"","abstract":"We have recently developed photonic crystal nanocavities and lasers from both InGaAsP quantum well and InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot materials. We have explored the design compromises for developing high-Q cavities and developed new geometries for sensitive low-threshold optical switches and spectroscopy sources. In this talk, we will review the design, fabrication and characterization of optical cavities defined within photonic crystals.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252469","docid":252469,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1259836","fileid":1259836,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252469,"filename":"01224269.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"b9d04824d52f9b845c3e7caa4c99909f","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":110648,"mtime":"2017-05-18 19:46:52","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77579/1/01224269.pdf"}],"eprintid":77579,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01224269.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2003 IEEE.","id":77579,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/75/79","datestamp":"2017-05-18 19:57:45","lastmod":"2017-05-18 19:57:45","status_changed":"2017-05-18 19:57:45","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"A.","family":"Scherer","id":"Scherer-A","orcid":""},{"given":"T.","family":"Yoshie","id":"Yoshie-Tomoyuki","orcid":""},{"given":"M.","family":"Loncar","id":"Loncar-M","orcid":""},{"given":"J.","family":"Vuckovic","id":"Vučković-J","orcid":""},{"given":"D.
