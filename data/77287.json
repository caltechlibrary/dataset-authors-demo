{"title":"Large Deviations and Sum Rules for Spectral Theory - A Pedagogical Approach","uri":"","abstract":"This is a pedagogical exposition of the large deviation\napproach to sum rules pioneered by Gamboa, Nagel and Rouault. We'll explain how to use their ideas to recover the Szegö and Killip-Simon Theorems. The primary audience is spectral theorists and people working on orthogonal polynomials who have limited familiarity with the theory of large deviations.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/251939","docid":251939,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1255448","fileid":1255448,"datasetid":"document","objectid":251939,"filename":"p339.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"29f00744577810401dafbd84dc84ef4f","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":412506,"mtime":"2017-05-09 15:11:58","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77287/1/p339.pdf"}],"eprintid":77287,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"p339.pdf","content":"submitted"}],"note":"Date: November 30, 2016. \n\nResearch supported in part by Israeli BSF Grant No. 2014337.\nResearch supported in part by NSF grant DMS-1265592 and in part by Israeli BSF Grant No. 2014337.
