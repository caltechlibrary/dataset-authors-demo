{"title":"Assessment of predictive capabilities for aerodynamic heating in hypersonic flow","uri":"","abstract":"The capability for CFD prediction of hypersonic shock wave laminar boundary layer interaction was assessed for a double wedge model at Mach 7.1 in air and nitrogen at 2.1 MJ/kg and 8 MJ/kg. Simulations were performed by seven research organizations encompassing both Navier-Stokes and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) methods as part of the NATO STO AVT Task Group 205 activity. Comparison of the CFD simulations with experimental heat transfer and schlieren visualization suggest the need for accurate modeling of the tunnel startup process in short-duration hypersonic test facilities, and the importance of fully 3-D simulations of nominally 2-D (i.e., non-axisymmmetric) experimental geometries.","documents":null,"note":"Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd. \n\nReceived 3 February 2017, Accepted 6 February 2017, Available online 10 February 2017.","id":77883,"rev_number":5,"userid":18,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/78/83","datestamp":"2017-06-01 21:06:44","lastmod":"2017-06-01 21:06:44","status_changed":"2017-06-01 21:06:44","type":"article","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Doyle","family":"Knight","id":"Knight-D","orcid":""},{"given":"Olivier","family":"Chazot","id":"Chazot-O","orcid":""},{"given":"Joanna","family":"Austin","id":"Austin-J-M","orcid":""},{"given":"Mohammad Ali","family":"Badr","id":"Badr-M-A","orcid":""},{"given":"Graham","family":"Candler","id":"Candler-G-V","orcid":""},{"given":"Bayram","family":"Celik","id":"Celik-B","orcid":""},{"given":"Donato","family":"de Rosa","id":"de Rosa-D","orcid":""},{"given":"Raffaele","family":"Donelli","id":"Donelli-R","orcid":""},{"given":"Jeffrey","family":"Komives","id":"Komives-J","orcid":""},{"given":"Andrea","family":"Lani","id":"Lani-A","orcid":""},{"given":"Deborah","family":"Levin","id":"Levin-D-A","orcid":""},{"given":"Ioannis","family":"Nompelis","id":"Nompelis-I","orcid":""},{"given":"Marco","family":"Panesi","id":"Panesi-M","orcid":""},{"given":"Giuseppe","family":"Pezzella","id":"Pezzella-G","orcid":""},{"given":"Bodo","family":"Reimann","id":"Reimann-B","orcid":""},{"given":"Ozgur","family":"Tumuklu","id":"Tumuklu-O","orcid":""},{"given":"Kemal","family":"Yuceil","id":"Yuceil-K","orcid":""}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"none","keywords":"Hypersonic; CFD; Heat transfer","date":"2017-04","date_type":"published","publication":"Progress in Aerospace Sciences","volume":"90","number":"","pagerange":"39-53","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170601-084222322","refereed":true,"issn":"0376-0421","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170601-084222322","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paerosci.2017.02.001","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376042117300337","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":null,"rights":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","official_citation":"Doyle Knight, Olivier Chazot, Joanna Austin, Mohammad Ali Badr, Graham Candler, Bayram Celik, Donato de Rosa, Raffaele Donelli, Jeffrey Komives, Andrea Lani, Deborah Levin, Ioannis Nompelis, Marco Panesi, Giuseppe Pezzella, Bodo Reimann, Ozgur Tumuklu, Kemal Yuceil, Assessment of predictive capabilities for aerodynamic heating in hypersonic flow, Progress in Aerospace Sciences, Volume 90, April 2017, Pages 39-53, ISSN 0376-0421, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paerosci.2017.02.001.\n(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376042117300337)","other_numbering_system":null,"funders":null,"collection":"CaltechAUTHORS","reviewer":"George Porter","local_group":null}
