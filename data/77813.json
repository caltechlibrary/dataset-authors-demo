{"title":"Measuring Flux Distributions for Diffusion in the Small-Numbers Limit","uri":"","abstract":"For the classical diffusion of independent particles, Fick's law gives a well-known relationship between the average flux and the average concentration gradient. What has not yet been explored experimentally, however, is the dynamical distribution of diffusion rates in the limit of small particle numbers. Here, we measure the distribution of diffusional fluxes using a microfluidics device filled with a colloidal suspension of a small number of microspheres. Our experiments show that (1) the flux distribution is accurately described by a Gaussian function; (2) Fick's law, that the average flux is proportional to the particle gradient, holds even for particle gradients down to a single particle difference; (3) the variance in the flux is proportional to the sum of the particle numbers; and (4) there are backward flows, where particles flow up a concentration gradient, rather than down it. In addition, in recent years, two key theorems about nonequilibrium systems have been introduced:  Evans' fluctuation theorem for the distribution of entropies and Jarzynski's work theorem. Here, we introduce a new fluctuation theorem, for the fluxes, and we find that it is confirmed quantitatively by our experiments.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252847","docid":252847,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1263997","fileid":1263997,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252847,"filename":"jp067036j.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"2070925a7ae8b3589414fbffd5b04d54","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":241951,"mtime":"2017-05-26 18:22:42","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77813/1/jp067036j.pdf"}],"eprintid":77813,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"jp067036j.pdf","content":"published"},{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252848","docid":252848,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1264004","fileid":1264004,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252848,"filename":"nihms-348976.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"177b768df5f5a4d2d4f94cf03a528d1e","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":721028,"mtime":"2017-05-26 18:26:36","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77813/2/nihms-348976.pdf"}],"eprintid":77813,"pos":2,"placement":2,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"nihms-348976.pdf","content":"accepted"}],"note":"© 2007 American Chemical Society. \n\nReceived: October 26, 2006; In Final Form: December 27, 2006.

For such large particle separations, electrostatic22 and hydrodynamic interactions23,24 are negligible. Although the polystyrene particles have a small negative surface charge, it is readily shown using the Poisson−Boltzmann equation that there is little interaction at these separations, and we confirmed that result by an experiment showing an independence on salt concentrations (data not shown). Also, the data of Meiners and Quake23 and Dufresne et al.,24 applied to our system, show that hydrodynamic interactions should be small.\n\n\nOpenURL CALIFORNIA INST OF TECHNOLOGY \n\nThe results obtained under the equilibrium setting were similar to the ones presented in this paper. However, the equilibrium measurements were not presented, since the local concentration gradient was obviously rather small, thus limiting the range of ΔN values.\n\n\nOpenURL CALIFORNIA INST OF TECHNOLOGY \n\n(21) The jump probability, p, in the time interval, Δt, from bin i − 1 to bin i (of size Δx) can be estimated from the diffusion of a particle with diffusion coefficient D. However, there is also a possibility of a jump occurring from any of the other bins to bin i. After summing all of the jump probabilities from all of the neighboring bins, the effective probability, p, is found to be p ≃ 0.33, for the given values of Δx, Δt, and D.\n\n\nOpenURL CALIFORNIA INST OF TECHNOLOGY \n\n(22) Crocker, J.
