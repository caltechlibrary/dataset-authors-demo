{"title":"Electrolysis-based on-chip dispensing system for ESI-MS","uri":"","abstract":"We report here an integrated on-chip sample dispensing system for Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) applications. The stand-alone chip includes an electrolysis-based micropump, a passive micro mixer and an ESI nozzle. Operation of the chip doesn't require any external fluidic coupling because the chip is designed to have samples filled, sealed and stored in reservoirs inside the chip before testing. Demonstrated here is a chip with two sample reservoirs and dispensing of the samples is electrically controlled individually. Experimentally, on-chip co-dispensing of two different samples is successfully achieved with a dispensing flow rate about 50 nl/min and a continuous spray for 2 minutes.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252472","docid":252472,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1259876","fileid":1259876,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252472,"filename":"01189781.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"449f43aaa4c7f2d089dd45ba536d43d2","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":351181,"mtime":"2017-05-18 20:17:44","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77582/1/01189781.pdf"}],"eprintid":77582,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"01189781.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2003 IEEE. \n\nThis work is supported in part by NSF (Grant No. EEC-9402726) and NIH (Grant No.  5R01 RR06217-10).
