{"title":"A thermopneumatic microfluidic system","uri":"","abstract":"A self-contained planar microfluidic system using thermopneumatic actuation has been demonstrated. Using a novel suspended silicon island heater fabricated by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), and a precision machined acrylic fluidic substrate with a matching silicone rubber membrane, a self-contained system of channels, valves, and a pump has been demonstrated using air as a working fluid.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252576","docid":252576,"rev_number":3,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261595","fileid":1261595,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252576,"filename":"00984051.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"8603c4a256bf6b3c59267d042c27ed02","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":571899,"mtime":"2017-05-22 23:54:25","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77641/1/00984051.pdf"}],"eprintid":77641,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"public","license":"other","main":"00984051.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"© 2002 IEEE. \n\nThis work is supported by DARPA/MTO MicroFlumes Program under Naval Ocean Systems Center Contract N66001-96-8632  and the NSF Center for Neuromorphic System Engineering at Caltech.","id":77641,"rev_number":8,"userid":207,"eprint_dir":"disk0/00/07/76/41","datestamp":"2017-05-23 14:56:33","lastmod":"2017-05-23 14:56:33","status_changed":"2017-05-23 14:56:33","type":"book_section","metadata_visibility":"show","creators":[{"given":"Charles","family":"Grosjean","id":"Grosjean-C","orcid":""},{"given":"Xing","family":"Yang","id":"Yang-Xing","orcid":""},{"given":"Yu-Chong","family":"Tai","id":"Tai-Yu-Chong","orcid":"0000-0001-8529-106X"}],"ispublished":"pub","subjects":null,"full_text_status":"public","keywords":"","date":"2002-01","date_type":"published","publication":"","volume":"","number":"","pagerange":"24-27","id_number":"CaltechAUTHORS:20170522-165050873","refereed":true,"issn":"","official_url":"http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20170522-165050873","related_url":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2002.984051","type":"doi","description":"Article"},{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/984051/","type":"pub","description":"Article"}],"referencetext":["[l] \nC. \nGrosjean  and \nY. \nC.
