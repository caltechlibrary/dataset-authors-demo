{"title":"Multimission observations of the old nova GK Per during the 2015 outburst","uri":"","abstract":"GK Per, a classical nova of 1901, is thought to undergo variable mass accretion on to a magnetized white dwarf (WD) in an intermediate polar system (IP). We organized a multi-mission observational campaign in the X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) energy ranges during its dwarf nova (DN) outburst in 2015 March-April. Comparing data from quiescence and near outburst, we have found that the maximum plasma temperature decreased from about 26 to 16.2+/-0.4 keV. This is consistent with the previously proposed scenario of increase in mass accretion rate while the inner radius of the magnetically disrupted accretion disc shrinks, thereby lowering the shock temperature. A NuSTAR observation also revealed a high-amplitude WD spin modulation of the very hard X-rays with a single-peaked profile, suggesting an obscuration of the lower accretion pole and an extended shock region on the WD surface. The X-ray spectrum of GK Per measured with the Swift X-Ray Telescope varied on time-scales of days and also showed a gradual increase of the soft X-ray flux below 2 keV, accompanied by a decrease of the hard flux above 2 keV. In the Chandra observation with the High Energy Transmission Gratings, we detected prominent emission lines, especially of Ne, Mg and Si, where the ratios of H-like to He-like transition for each element indicate a much lower temperature than the underlying continuum. We suggest that the X-ray emission in the 0.8-2 keV range originates from the magnetospheric boundary.","documents":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/document/252614","docid":252614,"rev_number":2,"files":[{"id":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/file/1261927","fileid":1261927,"datasetid":"document","objectid":252614,"filename":"stx851.pdf","mime_type":"application/pdf","hash":"6915ee85082728c91b070202db05a204","hash_type":"MD5","filesize":3403398,"mtime":"2017-05-23 20:00:46","url":"http://authors.library.caltech.edu/77665/1/stx851.pdf"}],"eprintid":77665,"pos":1,"placement":1,"mime_type":"application/pdf","format":"application/pdf","language":"en","security":"internal","license":"other","main":"stx851.pdf","content":"published"}],"note":"Â© 2017 The Authors.
